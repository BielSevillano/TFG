                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                
                Greatest common divisor

Write a program that computes the greatest common divisor of two
numbers.

Input

Input consists of two strictly positive natural numbers a and b.

Output

Print the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Observation

Although the solution to this exercise does not need to be very
efficient, it should not be too slow.

                This is the program:

                from yogi import read

n=read(int)
m=read(int)

if n > m:
    d = m
else: 
    d = n

while n%d != 0 or m % d != 0: # mentre no tinguis el divisor de n i m repeteix el programa. 
    d = d-1

print("The gcd of", n, "and", m,  "is", d, ".")

                The result of the program is: Execution Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                from yogi import read

n = read(int)
m = read(int)

while m != 0:
    r = n % m
    n = m
    m = r
    
print(n)
