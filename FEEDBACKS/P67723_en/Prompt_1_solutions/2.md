## Feedback for GCD Program

### Problem and Solution Approach

The problem asks for a program to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers. The provided solution uses the Euclidean algorithm, a well-known and efficient method for finding the GCD. The algorithm iteratively replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the smaller number becomes zero. At that point, the larger number holds the GCD.

### Code Analysis

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The program correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the GCD. This is a standard and efficient approach.
*   **Readable Variable Names (mostly):** `a` and `b` are clear inputs. `a1` and `b1` are used to preserve the original inputs for the output message, which is a good practice.
*   **Use of `yogio.read`:** The use of `yogio.read` suggests adherence to potential competitive programming environment requirements, which is appropriate.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Output Formatting:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is likely the output format. The problem statement, while not explicitly showing an example output, implies that only the GCD itself should be printed. The provided code prints a descriptive string like "The gcd of X and Y is Z .". This extra text is likely not expected by the judging system.
*   **Unnecessary Intermediate Variables:** While `a1` and `b1` are used to preserve the original values, the core of the Euclidean algorithm can be implemented directly on `a` and `b` if the original values are not needed for the final output. This would simplify the code slightly.

### Suggestions for Improvement

The main improvement needed is to **adjust the output to match the expected format**. Based on the typical requirements of such problems and the simpler output of the reference solution, the program should *only* print the calculated GCD.

**Revised Code (Focusing on Output):**

```python
from yogi import read

a = read(int)
b = read(int)

# Store original values if you still want to print them later for debugging
# original_a = a
# original_b = b

while b != 0:
    r = a % b
    a = b
    b = r

# Only print the GCD
print(a)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Removed Descriptive Output:** The line `print("The gcd of", a, "and", b,  "is", a1, ".")` has been replaced with `print(a)`.
2.  **Simplified Variable Usage:** The Euclidean algorithm is now directly applied to `a` and `b`. If you *absolutely* needed the original values for some reason (which isn't the case here given the output requirement), you would keep `a1` and `b1` or similar, but for this problem, it's unnecessary complexity. The reference solution also directly modifies its input variables.

**Considering the Observation:**

The observation states that the solution doesn't need to be "very efficient" but "should not be too slow." The Euclidean algorithm is indeed efficient and will easily pass this condition. The "Wrong Answer" is purely a formatting issue, not an algorithmic performance one.

By changing the output to just print the GCD, the program will likely pass the tests.
