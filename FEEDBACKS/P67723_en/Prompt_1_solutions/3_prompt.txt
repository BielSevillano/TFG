                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                
                Greatest common divisor

Write a program that computes the greatest common divisor of two
numbers.

Input

Input consists of two strictly positive natural numbers a and b.

Output

Print the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Observation

Although the solution to this exercise does not need to be very
efficient, it should not be too slow.

                This is the program:

                from yogi import *

a = read (int)
b = read (int)

if a == b:
    d = a
elif a > b:
    d = b
else: d = a
while not (a % d == 0 and b % d == 0): #a % d != 0 or b % d != 0
    d = d -1

print ("The gcd of " + str (a) + " and " + str (b) + " is " + str (d) + ".")

                The result of the program is: Execution Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                from yogi import read

n = read(int)
m = read(int)

while m != 0:
    r = n % m
    n = m
    m = r
    
print(n)
