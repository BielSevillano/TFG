The problem asks to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers.

The provided solution attempts to solve this problem using a variation of the Euclidean algorithm. It stores the original input numbers in `c` and `d` for the final output. The core logic iterates using a `while` loop as long as `b` is not zero. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder `r` of `a` divided by `b`, then updates `a` to `b` and `b` to `r`. Finally, it prints the GCD.

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The core logic implements the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient and correct method for finding the GCD.
*   **Preserves Original Numbers:** The code correctly stores the original input numbers in `c` and `d` to be used in the final output statement.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **"Wrong Answer" Status:** The program received a "Wrong Answer" verdict, indicating there's an issue with its output or logic for certain test cases.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The provided code is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm and should generally produce the correct GCD. The "Wrong Answer" suggests a subtle issue, possibly related to:

1.  **Input/Output Formatting:** The output message is hardcoded as "The gcd of ... is ...". While this is generally fine, some online judges are very strict about exact output formatting, including spaces and punctuation. The comment `# per nombres grans utilitzar algorisme d'Euclides(if a=b ja tens resultat, sino resta el més petit al més gran i torna a començar)` and `# per millorar l'algorisme (nombre gran i l'altre petit) utilitzar % de a/b` seem to be internal notes and should be removed from the final code.

2.  **Edge Cases (though less likely for strictly positive naturals):** While the problem states "strictly positive natural numbers," it's always good to be mindful of potential edge cases, although for GCD, the Euclidean algorithm is robust.

3.  **Integration with `yogi` library:** The code uses `from yogi import read`. Ensure that `yogi` is correctly installed and that `read(int)` functions as expected for receiving integer inputs.

**Specific points to check/modify based on typical "Wrong Answer" issues:**

*   **Output String:**
    The line `print('The gcd of',c,'and',d,'is',a)` might be causing issues if the judge expects a specific format. For example, if the judge expects a newline character at the end, and it's not present, or if there are extra spaces.

    **Recommendation:** Consider using f-strings for more controlled output formatting:
    ```python
    print(f'The gcd of {c} and {d} is {a}.')
    ```
    This format ensures consistent spacing and a period at the end.

*   **Removal of Comments:** The comments within the `print` statement are unprofessional and could potentially interfere with the judge's parsing if they are not recognized as comments. Remove them or place them outside the executable code.

**Revised Code Example (incorporating suggestions):**

```python
from yogi import read

a = read(int)
b = read(int)
c = a  # Store original value of a
d = b  # Store original value of b

# Euclidean algorithm
while b != 0:
    r = a % b
    a = b
    b = r

# Print the result using f-string for precise formatting
print(f'The gcd of {c} and {d} is {a}.')
```

By ensuring precise output formatting and removing extraneous comments, the solution is more likely to pass. The core algorithmic logic is sound.
