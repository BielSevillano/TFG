This program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers. The solution uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD.

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm and produces the accepted output.
*   **Readability:** The code is well-structured with clear function definitions and descriptive variable names (though some are in Catalan, which is acceptable given the context of the programming platform).
*   **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm is a highly efficient method for calculating GCD, satisfying the problem's "not too slow" observation.
*   **Use of `yogı.read`:** This is appropriate for the specified input method.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Helper Functions `max2` and `min2`:** While functional, the `max2` and `min2` helper functions are not strictly necessary for the Euclidean algorithm as implemented. The algorithm can be written more compactly by directly handling the initial assignment of the larger and smaller numbers to variables `c` and `d`.
*   **Redundant Initialization in `gcd`:** Inside the `gcd` function, `c = max2(a, b)` and `d = min2(a, b)` are called. Then, the `while` loop updates `c` and `d` in a way that effectively swaps them. This could be slightly simplified.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Simplify `gcd` function:** The `gcd` function can be made more concise by directly initializing the variables used in the Euclidean algorithm. The standard iterative form of the Euclidean algorithm doesn't require explicit `max2` and `min2` calls upfront.

    Here's a more streamlined version of the `gcd` function:

    ```python
    def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """Donats dos enters, en retorna el seu màxim comú divisor, algoritme d'Euclides"""
        while b != 0:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    ```

    This version directly uses tuple unpacking to perform the swaps and modulo operations, which is a common and efficient way to implement the iterative Euclidean algorithm in Python.

2.  **Direct Input Handling:** While the separate functions are good for modularity, for a problem as straightforward as this, the input reading and the GCD calculation could potentially be combined directly in the main part of the script if extreme conciseness was desired (though the current approach is perfectly fine for readability).

**Example of the simplified `gcd` function in use:**

```python
from yogi import read

def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Donats dos enters, en retorna el seu màxim comú divisor, algoritme d'Euclides"""
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

a = read(int)
b = read(int)
print("The gcd of ", a, " and ", b, " is ", gcd(a, b), ".", sep="")
```

This revised version achieves the same result with fewer lines of code in the `gcd` function while maintaining clarity and efficiency.
