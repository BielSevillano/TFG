This feedback addresses a "Wrong Answer" for a program designed to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers.

## Feedback on GCD Program

**Problem Summary:**

The task is to write a program that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given positive integers. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

**Solution Approach:**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the **Euclidean algorithm**. This is a highly efficient and standard method for calculating the GCD. The algorithm works by repeatedly applying the modulo operation until the remainder is zero. The GCD is then the last non-zero remainder.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The program correctly implements the core logic of the Euclidean algorithm. This is a significant strength as it uses an appropriate and efficient method.
*   **Clear Variable Naming (Partially):** `a` and `b` are standard for this algorithm. `n1` and `n2` are used to store the original input values for the final output, which is good practice.
*   **Use of `yogi.read()`:** This indicates the program is designed to work with the `yogi` input library, which is common in competitive programming platforms.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Output Formatting:** The most likely cause of the "Wrong Answer" is the output format. The problem statement specifies a particular output format. Your code prints: `The gcd of {n1} and {n2} is {a}`. Many of the reference solutions show output like "The gcd of X and Y is Z." or similar variations, often with specific spacing or capitalization. **The absence of a trailing period (`.`) in your output is a common reason for a "Wrong Answer" on many platforms.**

*   **No Error Handling:** While the problem statement guarantees strictly positive natural numbers, in a more robust scenario, you might consider handling cases like zero or negative inputs. However, for this specific problem, it's not a cause for the current error.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The primary suggestion is to **correct the output format**. Based on the problem statement and the reference solutions, you likely need to:

1.  **Add a trailing period (`.`)** to the output string.
    *   Change: `print(f'The gcd of {n1} and {n2} is {a}')`
    *   To: `print(f'The gcd of {n1} and {n2} is {a}.')`

**Example of Corrected Output:**

If the input is `12` and `18`, the correct output should be:
`The gcd of 12 and 18 is 6.`

**Conclusion:**

The logic of your program for calculating the GCD is sound and implements the Euclidean algorithm correctly. The "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly due to a minor discrepancy in the output formatting, specifically the missing period. By adding the period, your program should pass.
