### Feedback for "Nombre de dígits (1)" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Nombre de dígits (1)" requires the user to write a program that reads a natural number `n` and outputs the total count of its digits. For instance, if the input is 123, the expected output is 3. If the input is 0, the expected output is 1.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program implements a common arithmetic approach to count digits:
1.  It reads the input integer `n` and stores a copy in `n2` to preserve the original value.
2.  It specifically handles the case where `n` is 0, assigning a digit count of 1.
3.  For any positive `n`, it initializes a counter `d` to 0. It then enters a `while` loop, repeatedly performing integer division (`n //= 10`) and incrementing `d`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0, effectively counting how many digits were "removed" by division.
4.  Finally, it prints the original number (`n2`) and the calculated digit count (`d`).

**Code's Strengths:**
*   **Correct Logic for Positive Integers:** The core algorithm using integer division is mathematically sound and correctly counts digits for any positive integer.
*   **Correct Handling of Zero:** The program explicitly covers the case `n = 0`, correctly identifying that it has one digit.
*   **Readability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making its logic clear.
*   **Preservation of Original Input:** Using `n2` to store the original value of `n` is a good practice, especially since `n` is modified within the loop.

**Code's Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
*   **Redundant Output for `n = 0`:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is that for the input `n = 0`, the program prints the output *twice*. There is a `print` statement inside the `if n == 0:` block, and another identical `print` statement is executed *after* the `if/else` structure, regardless of the input. Online judges require exact output matching, so any extra or missing lines will result in a "Wrong Answer".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Consolidate Print Statement (Recommended Fix):** The most direct fix to achieve the correct output format is to ensure the final `print` statement is only executed once for all cases. Move the `print` statement outside the `if/else` block, so it runs only after `d` has been determined.

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    n2 = n # Store the original number

    if n == 0:
        d = 1
    else:
        d = 0
        while n != 0:
            n = n // 10
            d = d + 1

    # This single print statement handles all cases correctly
    print('El nombre de digits de', n2, 'es', d)
    ```

2.  **Alternative Approach (Pythonic):** For simple digit counting in Python, converting the number to a string and getting its length is a very concise and often preferred method. This implicitly handles the `n = 0` case as well.

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    print('El nombre de digits de', n, 'es', len(str(n)))
    ```
