Here's a feedback text for the provided program:

**Problem:** The problem asks to read a non-negative integer and output the number of digits it contains.

**Solution Approach:** The provided Python program takes an integer as input and then uses a function `nombre_dig` to calculate the number of digits. This function iteratively divides the input number by 10 until it becomes 0, incrementing a counter in each step. A special case for 0 is handled to return 1 digit.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly solves the problem, including the edge case of the input being 0.
*   **Readability:** The code is generally readable, with clear variable names (though `s` could be more descriptive). The function `nombre_dig` is well-defined and encapsulates the logic for counting digits.
*   **Use of `easyinput`:** The program correctly utilizes the `easyinput` library for reading input.
*   **Output Formatting:** The output format matches the required "El nombre de digits de X es Y."

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Redundant `int(x)` in print statement:** In the `print` statement, `int(x)` is used again. Since `x` is already read as an integer, this conversion is unnecessary.
*   **Efficiency for very large numbers:** While not a significant issue for typical competitive programming constraints, converting the number to a string and then getting its length is often a more concise and potentially faster approach for calculating the number of digits in Python. The iterative division method, while correct, can be slightly more verbose.
*   **No `main` function:** For larger programs, it's a good practice to wrap the main execution logic within a `main` function.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Simplify the print statement:** Remove the redundant `int(x)` conversion:
    ```python
    print("El nombre de digits de ", x, " es ", nombre_dig(x), '.', sep='')
    ```

2.  **Consider a string-based approach for conciseness (Optional but recommended):** A more Pythonic and often simpler way to solve this problem is by converting the integer to a string and then finding the length of the string.
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    x = read(int)
    print("El nombre de digits de ", x, " es ", len(str(x)), '.', sep='')
    ```
    This approach also naturally handles the case of 0.

3.  **Encapsulate in a `main` function:** For better program structure, especially if the program were to grow, you could add a `main` function:
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    def nombre_dig(s):
        d = 0
        if s == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            while s > 0:
                s = s // 10
                d = d + 1
            return d

    def main():
        x = read(int)
        print("El nombre de digits de ", x, " es ", nombre_dig(x), '.', sep='')

    main()
    ```

**Overall:** The program is a good and correct solution to the problem. The suggested improvements focus on minor stylistic enhancements and offering a more idiomatic Python approach for this specific task.
