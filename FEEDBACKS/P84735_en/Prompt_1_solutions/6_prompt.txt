                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                                Smallest multiple

Write a program that reads pairs of natural numbers a and b, and for
each one prints the smallest natural number that is greater than or
equal to a and also a multiple of b.

Input

Input consists of a sequence of pairs of natural numbers a and b with
b ≥ 1.

Output

For each a and b, print in a line the smallest natural number x such
that x ≥ a and x = mb for some natural number m. Precede this with the
case number starting at 1, following the format of the example.

                This is the program:

                from yogi import scan
def calcul(a:int, b:int)->int:
    aux = a
    while aux % b != 0:
        aux +=1
    return aux

def main()->None:
    a = scan(int)
    b = scan(int)
    cops = 1
    while a is not None:
        print("#", cops," : ",calcul(a,b), sep="")
        cops +=1
        a,b = scan(int), scan(int)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

                The result of the program is: Execution Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int maxi(int x, int y, int& max, int& min){
    if(x>y)max = x,min = y;
    else max = y,min = x;
}

int mcm (int max, int min){
    if (min == 1 or max == 1) return max*min;
    if (max%min == 0) return max;
    for(int i =2;i*i<max;++i) if(i*min>=max) return i*min;
    return max*min;
}

int main(){
    int x,y,max,min;
    int contador = 1;
    while (cin >> x >> y){
        maxi(x,y,max,min);
        cout <<"#" << contador << " : "<< mcm (max,min) << endl;
        ++contador;
    }
}
