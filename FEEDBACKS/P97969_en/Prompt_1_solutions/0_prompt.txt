                This is the program:

                

import sys

resultat = 0
for token in sys.stdin:
    for c in token.split():
        if c == '.':
            break
        elif c == 'a':
            resultat += 1
print(resultat)

                The result of the program is: Wrong Answer

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                def count_a(sentence):
    count = 0
    for char in sentence:
        if char == 'a':
            count += 1

    print(count)

sentence = input()
count_a(sentence)
