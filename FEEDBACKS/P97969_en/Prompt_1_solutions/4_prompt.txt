                This is the program:

                from yogi import read
from yogi import tokens
frase=""
for a in tokens(str):
    frase+=a

print(frase.count("a"))

                The result of the program is: Accepted

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                def count_a(sentence):
    count = 0
    for char in sentence:
        if char == 'a':
            count += 1

    print(count)

sentence = input()
count_a(sentence)
