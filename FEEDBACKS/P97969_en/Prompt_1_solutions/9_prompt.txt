                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                                Counting a’s (1)

                This is the program:

                from jutge import read_line
a=read_line()
aa = "a"
b = 0
for d in a:
    if d == aa;:
        b+=1
        
print(b)

                The result of the program is: Compilation Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                def count_a(sentence):
    count = 0
    for char in sentence:
        if char == 'a':
            count += 1

    print(count)

sentence = input()
count_a(sentence)
