                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                                Counting a’s (1)

Write a program that reads a sequence of characters ended with a period
and prints the number of letters ‘a’ in the sequence.

Input

Input consists of a sequence of characters ended in a period.

Output

Print the number of times that ‘a’ appears in the sequence.

                This is the program:

                count_a = 0
sequence = input("Enter a sequence of characters (end with a period): ")
for char in sequence:
  if char == 'a' or char == 'A':
    count_a += 1
print("The number of times 'a' appears in the sequence:", count_a)


                The result of the program is: Wrong Answer

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                def count_a(sentence):
    count = 0
    for char in sentence:
        if char == 'a':
            count += 1

    print(count)

sentence = input()
count_a(sentence)
