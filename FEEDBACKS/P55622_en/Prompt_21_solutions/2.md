This program addresses the problem of determining the number of digits in a given natural number. The solution approach involves repeatedly dividing the input number by 10 until it becomes less than 10, incrementing a counter for each division.

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The code correctly implements the described logic and produces the correct output for the given problem constraints.
*   **Readability:** The variable names `n` and `numDig` are reasonably clear, and the structure of the `while` loop is easy to follow.
*   **Variable Preservation:** The code correctly preserves the original input number `n` by creating a copy `copy` to perform the calculations on, which is then used in the final output string.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Floating-Point Division:** The use of `copy /= 10` (floating-point division) might introduce subtle precision issues for very large numbers, although for typical integer ranges in competitive programming, this is unlikely to be a problem. Integer division (`//`) would be more robust and directly align with the concept of digit removal.
*   **Efficiency (Minor):** While efficient enough for this problem, converting to a string and then getting its length (as seen in some other solutions) can sometimes be more concise and equally or more performant depending on the implementation.
*   **Output Formatting:** The output string is constructed using string concatenation. While functional, f-strings (formatted string literals) are generally considered more modern and readable in Python.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Use Integer Division:** Replace `copy /= 10` with `copy //= 10`. This will ensure integer arithmetic and avoid any potential floating-point inaccuracies.

    ```python
    copy = n = int(input())
    numDig = 1
    while copy >= 10:
        copy //= 10  # Use integer division
        numDig += 1
    print('The number of digits of ' + str(n) + ' is ' + str(numDig) + '.')
    ```

2.  **Consider String Conversion for Conciseness:** For a very concise solution, converting the number to a string and using `len()` is an idiomatic Python way to solve this.

    ```python
    n = int(input())
    print(f"The number of digits of {n} is {len(str(n))}.")
    ```
    This approach is often preferred for its simplicity and readability.

3.  **Use f-strings for Output:** For cleaner output formatting, consider using f-strings.

    ```python
    copy = n = int(input())
    numDig = 1
    while copy >= 10:
        copy //= 10
        numDig += 1
    print(f"The number of digits of {n} is {numDig}.")
    ```

Overall, the provided solution is functional and correctly solves the problem. The suggestions are minor refinements to enhance robustness and Pythonic style.
