                This is the program:

                from easyinput import read

entrada = read(int)
cadena = str(entrada)
print("Es numero de digits de ", entrada ," és ",len(cadena),".", sep="")

                The result of the program is: Invalid Character

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                s = input()

print(len(s))
