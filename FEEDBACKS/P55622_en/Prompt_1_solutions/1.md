**Feedback for P55622: Number of digits (1)**

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires you to read a natural number and output the count of its digits. Your program correctly identifies that converting the number to a string and then finding the length of that string is a valid approach to determine the number of digits.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core logic of converting the integer to a string and then using `len()` is fundamentally sound and will work for positive integers.
    *   **Use of `easyinput`:** You are using the `easyinput` library as suggested, which is good for structured input.
    *   **Clear Variable Naming:** `entrada` and `cadena` are reasonably descriptive for their purposes.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Format:** The most significant issue leading to a "Wrong Answer" is the output format. The problem statement expects *only* the number of digits to be printed. Your program prints a descriptive string: "The number of digits is X .". This extra text causes the judge to mark it as incorrect because it doesn't match the expected output precisely.
    *   **Potential for Redundancy:** While not strictly incorrect for this problem, creating an intermediate `cadena` variable is not strictly necessary. The conversion and length calculation could be combined.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Match Output Format Exactly:** The primary fix is to ensure your output matches the expected format. The judge will only accept the numerical count of the digits. Remove the descriptive text.

    *   **Revised Output Line:**
        ```python
        print(len(cadena))
        ```

2.  **Simplify Code (Optional but good practice):** You can combine the conversion and length calculation into a single step for a more concise solution.

    *   **Combined Logic:**
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        entrada = read(int)
        print(len(str(entrada)))
        ```
        This eliminates the need for the `cadena` variable.

**Reference Solution Comparison:**

The reference solution `s = input(); print(len(s))` directly reads the input as a string (`input()` by default reads strings in Python) and then prints its length. This is an even more direct approach if the input is guaranteed to be a string representation of a natural number. Your use of `read(int)` is also perfectly valid, but it necessitates the conversion back to a string for `len()`.

By addressing the output format, your program will correctly solve the problem.
