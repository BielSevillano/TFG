                This is the program:

                n = input()
mensaje = "The number of digits of "
print(mensaje + n + ' is ' + str(len(n)) +  ".")




                The result of the program is: Accepted

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                s = input()

print(len(s))
