The problem asks to write a program that reads a natural number and prints the count of its digits.

The provided solution attempts to solve this by defining a recursive function `nombre_digits(n)`. The logic is that if the number `n` is less than 10, it has 1 digit. Otherwise, it has 1 digit plus the number of digits in `n / 10`.

**Strengths:**

*   **Recursive Approach:** The solution correctly identifies a recursive structure for the problem. The base case (number < 10) is handled.
*   **Modularity:** The problem is broken down into a function `nombre_digits` and a `main` function, which is good practice.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Integer Division:** The primary issue leading to the "Wrong Answer" is the use of floating-point division (`n / 10`) within the recursive function. In Python, `/` performs float division. For integer arithmetic, `//` (integer division) should be used. When `n` is a large integer, `n / 10` will result in a float, and further divisions will continue to produce floats, which is not what's intended for counting digits. This can lead to unexpected results and potentially infinite recursion or incorrect counts.
*   **Output Format:** The expected output format in the problem description is simply the number of digits. The provided solution directly prints the result of `nombre_digits(n)`. While this might be acceptable if the problem strictly means *only* the number, many of the example solutions show a more descriptive output like "The number of digits of X is Y.". If the exact output format is crucial, the solution would need to be adjusted. However, the "Wrong Answer" is more likely due to the calculation itself rather than the output string.
*   **No Handling for 0:** Although the problem statement specifies "natural number n," which typically implies positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...), some interpretations might include 0. The current recursive function would not handle `n=0` correctly if it were to be considered. However, since the input is stated as a "natural number," this might not be the cause of the error.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Use Integer Division:** Replace `n / 10` with `n // 10` in the recursive call. This ensures that the division operates on integers, which is essential for correctly decrementing the number of digits.

    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    def nombre_digits(n):
        if n < 10:
            return 1
        else:
            # Use integer division //
            return 1 + nombre_digits(n // 10)

    def main():
        n = read(int)
        print(nombre_digits(n))

    main()
    ```

2.  **Consider Iterative Approach (Optional but often simpler):** An iterative approach using a `while` loop is generally more straightforward for this problem and avoids potential recursion depth issues for very large numbers. It also often has clearer logic for edge cases.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    def main():
        n = read(int)
        if n == 0:  # Handle the case of 0 if considered a natural number
            print(1)
        else:
            count = 0
            temp_n = n # Use a temporary variable to preserve original n if needed for output
            while temp_n > 0:
                temp_n //= 10
                count += 1
            print(count)

    main()
    ```

3.  **String Conversion (Simplest Approach):** The most Pythonic and often easiest way to solve this problem is by converting the number to a string and then finding the length of the string.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    def main():
        n = read(int)
        # Convert to string and get its length
        num_digits = len(str(n))
        print(num_digits)

    main()
    ```
    This approach directly matches one of the provided reference solutions and is very concise.

By correcting the division operator to integer division (`//`), the recursive solution should function correctly. However, exploring the iterative or string conversion methods might offer more robust and simpler alternatives.
