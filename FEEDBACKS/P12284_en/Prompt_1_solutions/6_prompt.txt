                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                Most frequent words

Write a program that reads a sequence of n words and prints the k most
frequent (in case of a tie, the smallest in alphabetical order).

Input

Input consists of several cases. Every case starts with n and k,
followed by n words made up of only lowercase letters. You can assume
that k is between 1 and the number of different words.

Output

For every case, print the k most frequent words in order. Print first
the most frequent words, and in case of a tie, the smallest words in
lexicographical order. Print a line with 10 dashes at the end of each
case.

                This is the program:

                from jutge import read

i = 0
counter = 0
n = read(str)
while n is not None:
	a = []
	for k in range(n):
		words = k.split()
		s = read(str)		
	for m in words:
		if m not in a:
			a.append(m)
	for m in words:
		while i<len(a):
			i += 1
			if m in a:
				counter += 1
	print(counter, + '----------')
	n = read(str)
	counter = 0


                The result of the program is: Execution Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                from jutge import read


n = read(int)
while n is not None:
	k = read(int)
	c = 0
	d = {}
	while c < n:
		s = read(str)
		if s not in d:
			d[s] = 1
		else:
			d[s] += 1
		c += 1

	
	freqs = set(sorted(d.values(), reverse=True)[:k])
	t = []

	for f in sorted(freqs, reverse=True):
		l = []
		for i in d:
			if d[i] == f:
				l.append(i)
		l = sorted(l)
		t += l

	for w in t[:k]:
		print(w)
	print('----------')
	n = read(int)
