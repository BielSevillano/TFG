                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                Most frequent words

Write a program that reads a sequence of n words and prints the k most
frequent (in case of a tie, the smallest in alphabetical order).

Input

Input consists of several cases. Every case starts with n and k,
followed by n words made up of only lowercase letters. You can assume
that k is between 1 and the number of different words.

Output

For every case, print the k most frequent words in order. Print first
the most frequent words, and in case of a tie, the smallest words in
lexicographical order. Print a line with 10 dashes at the end of each
case.

                This is the program:

                from jutge import read

n = read(int)

while n is not None:
    k = read(int)
    d = {}
    while n > 0:
        word = read(str)
        if word not in d:
            d[word] = 1
        else:
            d[word] += 1
        n -= 1
    else:
        lst = []
        lst2 = []
        i = 0       
        while k > 0:
            for key,value in sorted(d.items()):
                if value == max(d.values()):
                    lst.append(key)
                else:
                    lst2.append(key)
            lst.extend(sorted(lst2,reverse=True))
            while 0 != k:
                print(lst[i])
                k -=1
                i += 1
            k -= 1
                
    print(10*'-')
    n = read(int)


                The result of the program is: Execution Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                from jutge import read


n = read(int)
while n is not None:
	k = read(int)
	c = 0
	d = {}
	while c < n:
		s = read(str)
		if s not in d:
			d[s] = 1
		else:
			d[s] += 1
		c += 1

	
	freqs = set(sorted(d.values(), reverse=True)[:k])
	t = []

	for f in sorted(freqs, reverse=True):
		l = []
		for i in d:
			if d[i] == f:
				l.append(i)
		l = sorted(l)
		t += l

	for w in t[:k]:
		print(w)
	print('----------')
	n = read(int)
