                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                Most frequent words

Write a program that reads a sequence of n words and prints the k most
frequent (in case of a tie, the smallest in alphabetical order).

Input

Input consists of several cases. Every case starts with n and k,
followed by n words made up of only lowercase letters. You can assume
that k is between 1 and the number of different words.

Output

For every case, print the k most frequent words in order. Print first
the most frequent words, and in case of a tie, the smallest words in
lexicographical order. Print a line with 10 dashes at the end of each
case.

                This is the program:

                from jutge import read

n=read(int)
k=read(int)
dicfreq={}



while n is not None:	
	for i in range(n):
		w = read(str)
		if w in dicfreq:
			dicfreq[w] += 1
		else:
			dicfreq[w] = 1
		
	dv = sorted((sorted(dicfreq)), key=dicfreq.get, reverse=True)
	
	for i in dv:
		if k>0:
			print(i)
		else:
			break
		k= k-1
	print('----------')
	n=read(int)
	k=read(int)

		


                The result of the program is: Execution Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                from jutge import read


n = read(int)
while n is not None:
	k = read(int)
	c = 0
	d = {}
	while c < n:
		s = read(str)
		if s not in d:
			d[s] = 1
		else:
			d[s] += 1
		c += 1

	
	freqs = set(sorted(d.values(), reverse=True)[:k])
	t = []

	for f in sorted(freqs, reverse=True):
		l = []
		for i in d:
			if d[i] == f:
				l.append(i)
		l = sorted(l)
		t += l

	for w in t[:k]:
		print(w)
	print('----------')
	n = read(int)
