                Write a feedback text for the following program that solves the problem described below.
                
                Most frequent words

Write a program that reads a sequence of n words and prints the k most
frequent (in case of a tie, the smallest in alphabetical order).

Input

Input consists of several cases. Every case starts with n and k,
followed by n words made up of only lowercase letters. You can assume
that k is between 1 and the number of different words.

Output

For every case, print the k most frequent words in order. Print first
the most frequent words, and in case of a tie, the smallest words in
lexicographical order. Print a line with 10 dashes at the end of each
case.

                This is the program:

                from jutge import read

n = read(int)
k = read(int)



while n is not None:
	dic = {}
	for a in range(n):
		word = read(str)
		if word not in dic:
			dic[word] = 0
		else:
			dic[word] += 1
	res = sorted(dic)
	resultado = sorted(res, key=dic.get, reverse=True)
	
	for i in range(k):
		print(resultado[i])
		
	print(10*'-')
	n = read(int)
	k = read(int)	


                The result of the program is: Accepted

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                from jutge import read


n = read(int)
while n is not None:
	k = read(int)
	c = 0
	d = {}
	while c < n:
		s = read(str)
		if s not in d:
			d[s] = 1
		else:
			d[s] += 1
		c += 1

	
	freqs = set(sorted(d.values(), reverse=True)[:k])
	t = []

	for f in sorted(freqs, reverse=True):
		l = []
		for i in d:
			if d[i] == f:
				l.append(i)
		l = sorted(l)
		t += l

	for w in t[:k]:
		print(w)
	print('----------')
	n = read(int)
