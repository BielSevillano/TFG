### **Feedback: Taula de multiplicar**

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The expected output format is typically `n * i = result` for each line.

**Solution Approach:**
Your program takes a direct approach:
1.  It reads the input integer `n`.
2.  It uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
3.  Inside the loop, it calculates the product of `n` and the current iteration number `i`.
4.  It prints this calculated product on each line.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The line `nombre = int(input())` correctly reads an integer from standard input.
    *   **Correct Loop Range:** The `for i in range (1, 11):` loop correctly iterates from 1 up to and including 10, which is precisely what's needed for a multiplication table up to 10.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** `multiple = nombre * i` accurately calculates each product in the multiplication table.
    *   **Clear Variable Names:** `nombre` and `multiple` are descriptive.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Incorrect Output Format:** This is the primary reason for the "Wrong Answer". While your program calculates the correct values, it only prints the `multiple` itself. The problem statement (and standard practice for multiplication tables) usually implies a more descriptive output format, such as `n * i = result`. Automated judges are very strict about exact output matching.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust the Output Format:** To match the expected output format (e.g., `N * I = RESULT`), modify your `print` statement. You can achieve this using an f-string (recommended for modern Python) or by concatenating strings/using multiple arguments with `sep=""`.

    *   **Using f-string (most Pythonic):**
        ```python
        nombre = int(input())

        for i in range (1, 11):
        	multiple = nombre * i
        	print(f"{nombre} * {i} = {multiple}")
        ```
    *   **Using multiple arguments with `sep=""`:**
        ```python
        nombre = int(input())

        for i in range (1, 11):
        	multiple = nombre * i
        	print(nombre, "*", i, " = ", multiple, sep="")
        ```
    Both of these will produce output like:
    ```
    2 * 1 = 2
    2 * 2 = 4
    ...
    ```

Applying this simple change to the `print` statement should resolve the "Wrong Answer" issue. Your logic for calculation and iteration is sound; it's purely a matter of output presentation.
