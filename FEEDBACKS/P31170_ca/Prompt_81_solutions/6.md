### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The provided program implements a direct and effective solution. It first reads the input integer `n` using `yogi.read(int)`. Then, it uses a `for` loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Inside the loop, it constructs and prints each line of the multiplication table in the required `n * i = n*i` format, where `i` is the current multiplier.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the multiplication table logic, iterating through the correct range (1 to 10) and performing the multiplication accurately. The "Accepted" status confirms its correctness.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is extremely clear, concise, and easy to understand. The variable names (`n`, `i`) are standard and intuitive for this problem.
*   **Conciseness:** It's a very compact solution that achieves the task with minimal lines of code.
*   **Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=""` in the `print` statement is a good practice for precise output control, ensuring that no extra spaces are added between the elements of the output line, matching typical output requirements.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **No Major Weaknesses:** For this particular problem, which is simple and straightforward, the code has no significant weaknesses. It is a highly optimal and canonical solution.
*   **Lack of Function Encapsulation (Minor):** While not strictly necessary for such a small script, wrapping the logic in a function (e.g., `def print_multiplication_table(n): ...`) would be good practice for modularity and reusability in larger applications. However, for a single-purpose script like this, it's perfectly acceptable as is.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

Given the problem's simplicity and the program's efficiency, major improvements are not necessary. However, here are a couple of stylistic and best-practice suggestions:

*   **Encapsulate in a Function:** For better code organization, especially as programs grow, consider wrapping the logic in a function. This makes the code more modular and reusable.
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    def print_multiplication_table(num):
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(num, "*", i, " = ", num*i, sep="")

    n = read(int)
    print_multiplication_table(n)
    ```
*   **Using f-strings for Output (Stylistic):** Python's f-strings provide a modern and often more readable way to format output. This is purely a stylistic choice, as your current `print` statement with `sep=""` works perfectly.
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range (1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

Overall, the program is an excellent and efficient solution to the given problem.
