Here's a feedback text for the program:

**Feedback: Taula de multiplicar**

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a program that reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The provided program reads the input `n` correctly. It then attempts to generate the multiplication table by iterating through numbers `0` to `9` using a `for` loop with `range(10)` and printing `n` multiplied by each of these numbers.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Clear Intent:** The code clearly aims to solve the problem by reading `n` and using a loop for repetition.
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** It correctly uses `easyinput.read(int)` to get the integer `n`.
    *   **Basic Logic:** The multiplication `n*i` is correctly performed.
    *   **Loop Usage:** Using a `for` loop is an appropriate and efficient way to generate the table.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Multiplication Range:** The most significant issue, leading to the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is the `for i in range(10):` statement. This loop iterates `i` from `0` up to `9` (inclusive). A standard multiplication table ("taula de multiplicar") typically starts from `n * 1` and goes up to `n * 10`. The current implementation misses `n * 10` and includes `n * 0`, which is usually not part of the standard table.
    *   **Output Formatting:** While functional, the `print(str(n) + "*" + str(i), "=", n*i)` statement results in an extra space before the `=` sign because `print` automatically adds a space between arguments separated by commas. For example, it might output `2*5 = 10` (with a space before the `=`), whereas the typical expected format is `2*5 = 10` (with no space before the `=`).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Iteration Range:** To produce the standard multiplication table from 1 to 10, change the `range` in your `for` loop:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11): # This will iterate i from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
        # ... rest of your code ...
    ```
2.  **Refine Output Formatting (Optional but Recommended):** To ensure exact output matching, consider using f-strings or the `sep=""` argument in `print`:
    *   **Using f-strings (recommended for modern Python):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `sep=""` with multiple arguments:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
    Both of these methods will produce output like `2*5 = 10` without unintended extra spaces.

**Revised Code Example (incorporating suggestions):**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
for i in range(1, 11): # Corrected range to go from 1 to 10
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Improved output formatting using an f-string
```
