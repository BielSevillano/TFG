This program efficiently solves the problem of displaying a multiplication table for a given number.

### 1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:

The problem requires the program to read a single integer `n` (constrained between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table, showing the products of `n` with numbers from 1 to 10.

The provided program implements a straightforward and effective solution:
*   It reads the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)` and stores it in the variable `a`.
*   It then iterates through the numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)`.
*   Inside the loop, for each iteration `i`, it calculates the product `a * i` and assigns it to the variable `b`.
*   Finally, it prints the multiplication expression and its result in the format `a*i = b`.

### 2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the logic for generating a multiplication table and produces the expected output for the specified range.
*   **Simplicity and Clarity:** The code is concise and easy to understand, directly translating the problem requirements into functional Python code without unnecessary complexity.
*   **Standard Python Constructs:** It effectively utilizes fundamental Python features such as `for` loops with `range()` and basic arithmetic, making it idiomatic and maintainable.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Variable Naming:** While `a` and `b` are functional, they are generic. Using more descriptive names like `number` (or `n`, as in the problem description) for the input and `product` or `result` for the calculated value would improve code readability and maintainability, especially as programs grow larger.
*   **Output Formatting Style:** The `print(str(a) + "*" + str(i), "=", b)` line mixes string concatenation (`+`) with the `print` function's default behavior of adding spaces between comma-separated arguments. While this achieves the desired output format (e.g., `5*1 = 5`) for this problem, using f-strings or the `sep` argument of `print` can offer more explicit control and often result in cleaner code.

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement:

1.  **Improve Variable Naming:**
    Renaming `a` to `n` (or `number`) and `b` to `product` (or `result`) would make the code's purpose immediately clearer:
    ```python
    n = read(int) # 'n' aligns with the problem description
    for i in range(1, 11):
        product = n * i # 'product' clearly indicates the result of multiplication
        print(...) # Use n, i, product here
    ```

2.  **Modernize Output Formatting:**
    For cleaner and more explicit string formatting, especially in modern Python (3.6+), f-strings are highly recommended. Alternatively, the `sep` argument of the `print` function offers precise control over separators:

    *   **Using f-strings (recommended):**
        ```python
        n = read(int)
        for i in range(1, 11):
            product = n * i
            print(f"{n}*{i} = {product}")
        ```
        This approach is generally preferred for its readability and conciseness. It produces the same clean output format as your current solution (e.g., `5*1 = 5`).

    *   **Using `print` with `sep` for explicit control:**
        ```python
        n = read(int)
        for i in range(1, 11):
            product = n * i
            print(n, "*", i, " =", product, sep="")
        ```
        This method gives granular control over separators, ensuring no unintended spaces are introduced by default.
