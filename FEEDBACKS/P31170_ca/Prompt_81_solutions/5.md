### Feedback: Taula de Multiplicar

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`.

**Solution Approach:**
The program correctly identifies the need to read an integer input and then iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 to calculate their products with the input number. It uses a `for` loop to achieve this iteration.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The line `nombre = int(input())` successfully reads an integer value from the user, which is the necessary first step.
    *   **Correct Loop Range:** The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop correctly iterates `i` from 1 up to and including 10, covering all required multiplication factors.
    *   **Accurate Calculation:** The `multiple = nombre * i` statement correctly computes the product for each iteration.
    *   **Clear Variable Names:** Variables like `nombre` and `multiple` are descriptive and easy to understand.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Output Format (Primary Issue):** The program outputs only the calculated `multiple` value (`print(multiple)`). The problem description, while not explicitly detailing the output format, implies a standard "multiplication table" format (e.g., `N * I = RESULT`). This discrepancy in output format is the reason for the "Wrong Answer" result. For instance, if `n` is 2, the current program would output:
        ```
        2
        4
        6
        ...
        20
        ```
        whereas the expected output is likely closer to:
        ```
        2*1 = 2
        2*2 = 4
        2*3 = 6
        ...
        2*10 = 20
        ```
    *   **Platform-Specific Input (Minor):** While `int(input())` is standard Python, many competitive programming platforms (like Jutge.org, as seen in the reference solutions) often provide their own input mechanisms like `easyinput.read(int)` or `yogi.read(int)`. While `input()` might work, it's good practice to use the platform's recommended method if specified. However, this is not the cause of the "Wrong Answer" in this specific case.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format:** Modify the `print` statement to match the standard multiplication table format. Here are a few ways to do this:

    *   **Using multiple arguments with `sep=""` (recommended for explicit control):**
        ```python
        nombre = int(input())

        for i in range (1, 11):
            multiple = nombre * i
            print(nombre, "*", i, " = ", multiple, sep="")
        ```
        This ensures there are no extra spaces between `nombre`, `*`, `i`, `=`, and `multiple`.

    *   **Using f-strings (modern and concise):**
        ```python
        nombre = int(input())

        for i in range (1, 11):
            multiple = nombre * i
            print(f"{nombre}*{i} = {multiple}")
        ```

    *   **Using string concatenation:**
        ```python
        nombre = int(input())

        for i in range (1, 11):
            multiple = nombre * i
            print(str(nombre) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(multiple))
        ```

2.  **Consider Platform-Specific Input (if applicable):** If the platform typically uses `easyinput`, you might adapt the input line accordingly:
    ```python
    from easyinput import read
    nombre = read(int)
    # ... rest of your code ...
    ```

By implementing the suggested change to the `print` statement, your program will produce the output in the expected format and should pass the "Wrong Answer" test.
