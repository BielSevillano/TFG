### Feedback on "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Brief Summary:**
The problem asks to read an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. Your program correctly implements the core logic: it reads the input `n`, iterates from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop, and calculates the product `n * i` for each iteration.

**Code's Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input:** The line `n = read(int)` successfully reads the integer input as required.
*   **Correct Iteration Range:** The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop correctly covers the desired range for the multiplication table (from 1 up to and including 10).
*   **Correct Calculation:** The expression `n*i` accurately computes the multiplication result for each step.
*   **Clear Logic:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, directly translating the problem's requirements into a functional structure.

**Code's Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
The primary issue leading to the "Wrong Answer" is related to **output formatting**, specifically the handling of newlines.
*   The `print()` function in Python, by default, adds a newline character (`\n`) at the end of its output.
*   Your `print` statement includes an *additional* `"\n"` as one of its arguments: `print(n,"*", i, "=", n*i,"\n")`.
*   This results in each line of the multiplication table being followed by *two* newline characters (one from the default `print` behavior and one from your explicit argument), creating an extra blank line after each multiplication entry. This discrepancy in the output format likely causes it to not match the expected output exactly.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the Redundant Newline:** The simplest fix is to remove the explicit `"\n"` from your `print` statement. Python's `print` will still add one newline per call, which is the correct behavior for this problem.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(n,"*", i, "=", n*i) # Removed the "\n"
    ```

2.  **Control Spacing Precisely with `sep=""` (Recommended):** To ensure exact spacing as seen in many correct solutions, you can use the `sep=""` argument in the `print` function. This tells `print` not to put a space between its arguments by default, allowing you to control spaces explicitly.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="") # Using sep="" for exact spacing
    ```

3.  **Use f-strings for Cleaner Output (Modern Pythonic Way):** F-strings provide a very clean and readable way to format output in Python. They allow you to embed expressions directly within string literals.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Using an f-string
    ```

By making one of these changes, your program should produce the output in the expected format and pass the tests. Your underlying logic is perfectly sound!
