### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9, inclusive) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output should display each multiplication fact in the format `n * i = result`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program correctly reads the integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)`. Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication fact by concatenating strings for `n`, `*`, `i`, and `=` with the calculated product `n*i`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the required logic and produces the multiplication table from 1 to 10. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
*   **Readability:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`) are clear.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is very compact, solving the problem in just a few lines of code.
*   **Efficiency:** For the given constraints (n between 1 and 9), the program is highly efficient, performing a simple loop and basic arithmetic operations.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Output Formatting (Implicit Spaces):** The `print` statement `print (str(n)+"*"+str(i), "=", n*i)` uses multiple arguments separated by commas. Python's `print` function, by default, inserts a space character between arguments. This means the output will look like `5*1 = 5` (notice the spaces around `=`). While this is often acceptable, explicit control over spacing is generally preferred for precise output formatting.
*   **Wildcard Import:** `from easyinput import *` imports all names from the `easyinput` module. While minor for such a small script, it's generally considered best practice to import only the specific functions or classes needed (e.g., `from easyinput import read`) to avoid potential name collisions in larger projects.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Explicit Output Formatting:** To have finer control over the spacing and achieve a more "Pythonic" output, consider using f-strings (formatted string literals) or the `sep` argument in the `print` function.
    *   **Using f-strings (Recommended):**
        ```python
        # Original: print (str(n)+"*"+str(i), "=", n*i)
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This approach is generally preferred for its readability and conciseness when formatting strings. Many other successful solutions use this.
    *   **Using `sep=""`:**
        ```python
        # Original: print (str(n)+"*"+str(i), "=", n*i)
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        This removes all default spaces between arguments, allowing you to explicitly add spaces where desired (e.g., around `=`). Several other solutions also demonstrate this.

2.  **Specific Import:**
    *   Instead of `from easyinput import *`, it's better to use `from easyinput import read` since only the `read` function is used.

**Revised Code (Illustrating improvements):**

```python
from easyinput import read # Import only what's needed

n = read(int)

for i in range(1, 11):
    # Using an f-string for cleaner output formatting
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
```
