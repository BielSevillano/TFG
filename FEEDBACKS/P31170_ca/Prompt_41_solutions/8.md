This program effectively solves the "Taula de multiplicar" problem.

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output for each line should follow the format `n * i = result`.

The provided solution takes a direct and highly efficient approach. It first reads the integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. Then, it utilizes a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it prints the current multiplication expression (`n * i = n*i`) using a single `print` statement. Crucially, it employs `sep=''` to ensure that no extra spaces are inserted between the elements of the print statement, resulting in the exact desired output format.

**Code Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program accurately calculates and prints the multiplication table, adhering perfectly to the specified output format, which is confirmed by its "Accepted" status.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is remarkably clear and easy to understand. The variable names (`n` for the input number, `i` for the loop counter) are standard and intuitive. The logic flows naturally, making it simple to follow.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is very compact and gets straight to the point, achieving the task with minimal lines of code.
*   **Efficient Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=''` within the `print` function is an excellent technique for precise output control in Python, which is often a requirement in competitive programming to match exact string specifications.
*   **Appropriate Control Flow:** A `for` loop is the ideal construct for iterating a fixed number of times (from 1 to 10), making the solution robust and idiomatic Python.

**Code Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Function Encapsulation:** For larger programs or when aiming for better code organization, it's generally good practice to encapsulate specific functionalities within functions (e.g., `def print_multiplication_table(num):`). While not a critical flaw for such a small, single-purpose script, it improves modularity and reusability.
*   **No Explicit Input Validation:** The problem statement specifies that `n` will be between 1 and 9. The current code assumes valid input within this range and does not include explicit checks to handle `n` outside this range. However, for "Accepted" status, such validation is typically not required unless specified.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Encapsulate Logic in a Function:** To enhance modularity and reusability, consider wrapping the table printing logic within a function. This makes the code easier to test and integrate into larger systems.
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    def print_multiplication_table(num):
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(num, "*", i, " = ", num * i, sep='')

    n = read(int)
    print_multiplication_table(n)
    ```
2.  **Consider Using f-strings for Output:** While your current `print` statement with `sep=''` is perfectly functional and correct, f-strings (formatted string literals) can sometimes offer a more readable and concise way to format output, especially when combining variables and literal text.
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    Both methods achieve the same correct output, so this is mainly a stylistic preference.

In summary, this is an excellent and highly effective solution that demonstrates strong fundamental programming skills. The suggested improvements are minor refinements aimed at best practices rather than addressing any critical issues.
