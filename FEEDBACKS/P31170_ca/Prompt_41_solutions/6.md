### Feedback on "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Problem Description:**
The problem requires a program that reads a natural number `n` (guaranteed to be between 1 and 9, inclusive) and prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.

**Solution Approach:**
The program reads the integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then employs an `if` statement to check if `n` falls within a specific range. If the condition is met, a `for` loop iterates from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `s = n * i` and prints the multiplication expression along with its result in the format `n * i = s`.

**Strengths:**
*   **Clear Logic:** The core logic of using a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and calculate `n * i` is sound and directly addresses the problem's main requirement.
*   **Readability:** The variable names (`n`, `s`, `i`) are intuitive, making the code easy to understand.
*   **Correct Iteration Range:** The `range(1, 11)` correctly generates the multipliers from 1 to 10.

**Weaknesses and Cause of "Wrong Answer":**
*   **Critical Error: Incorrect Input Validation Condition:** The most significant flaw and the likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" is the `if 1 < n < 10:` condition. The problem statement specifies that `n` will be "entre 1 i 9," which implies an inclusive range (i.e., `n` can be 1, 2, ..., up to 9). However, the `1 < n < 10` condition *excludes* the values `n=1` and `n=9`. If the input `n` is `1` or `9`, the `if` condition will evaluate to `False`, and the program will not execute the `for` loop, thus printing no output. This directly contradicts the problem requirements and leads to an incorrect answer for valid inputs.
*   **Output Formatting (Minor):** The `print(n, "*", i, "=", s)` statement uses the default `sep=' '` for its arguments, which adds spaces between the elements. While this might be acceptable for some judges, competitive programming problems often expect a more precise output format (e.g., `3*1 = 3`), which usually requires explicitly setting `sep=''` or using f-strings for tighter control over spacing.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Correct the Input Validation:**
    *   **Option 1 (Recommended):** Change the `if` condition to `if 1 <= n <= 9:`. This will correctly include `n=1` and `n=9`, ensuring the program works for all specified valid inputs.
    *   **Option 2 (Alternative for competitive programming):** Given that the problem statement guarantees `n` will be between 1 and 9, the `if` condition can be removed entirely. In competitive programming, inputs are usually guaranteed to adhere to constraints, making explicit input validation redundant for correctness (though good for robustness in general software).
2.  **Refine Output Formatting:**
    *   For clearer and more consistent output, consider using an f-string:
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {s}")
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can explicitly set the separator in the `print` function:
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", s, sep='')
        ```
