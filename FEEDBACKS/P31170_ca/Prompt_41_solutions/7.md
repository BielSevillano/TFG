### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires a Python program to read a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output should follow a specific format: each line should show `n * i = result`, where `i` ranges from 1 to 10.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program reads the input number `n` using `yogi.read`. It then uses a `while` loop that iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 10`. Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication expression and its result.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer `n` using `from yogi import read` and `n = read(int)`, which is appropriate for the Jutge.org environment.
    *   **Correct Loop Range:** The `while` loop `i = 1; while i <= 10:` correctly iterates 10 times, covering the multipliers from 1 to 10 as required.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The `n*i` calculation for the product is accurate.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Output Format:** The program's main weakness, leading to the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is the output format.
        *   The statement `print(n, "*", i, "=", n*i)` uses `print` with multiple arguments. By default, `print` inserts a single space character (`' '`) between each argument. This results in an output like `5 * 1 = 5` (with spaces around the `*` symbol).
        *   Based on common interpretations of such problems on Jutge.org and the successful reference solutions, the expected format is typically `N*I = RESULT` (no spaces around the `*`, and a single space before and after the `=` sign). For example, `5*1 = 5`.
        *   This subtle difference in spacing is crucial for automated judging systems.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
To fix the "Wrong Answer" and match the expected output format, modify the `print` statement. Here are a few ways to achieve this, with the f-string method being the most modern and readable:

1.  **Using an f-string (Recommended):**
    This is the most Pythonic and clear way to control output formatting.
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # This will produce "N*I = RESULT"
        i = i + 1
    ```

2.  **Using `sep=''` with `print`:**
    You can explicitly control the separator in `print` to concatenate parts without default spaces. Note that you need to include spaces where they are desired.
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        # This concatenates strings directly, ensuring specific spacing
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        i = i + 1
    ```

3.  **Using String Concatenation:**
    Explicitly convert numbers to strings and concatenate them.
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n*i))
        i = i + 1
    ```

Implementing any of these changes will correct the output format and should lead to a "Correct Answer" verdict.
