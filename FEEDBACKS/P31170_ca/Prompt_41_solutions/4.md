### Feedback on the Multiplication Table Program

**1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary:**

The problem asks for a program that reads a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from `n*1` to `n*10`.

The provided program solves this problem by:
1.  Reading the input integer `n` using `yogi.read(int)`.
2.  Initializing a counter variable `i` to 1.
3.  Using a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
4.  Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication expression and its result using an f-string: `'{n}*{i} = {n*i}'`.
5.  Incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the logic to generate and print the multiplication table as specified. The "Accepted" result confirms its functional correctness.
*   **Readability:** The code is very clear, concise, and easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`) are standard and intuitive.
*   **Modern Python (f-strings):** The use of f-strings for output formatting (`f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}'`) is excellent. It provides a clean, readable, and efficient way to construct the output string compared to older string concatenation or `.format()` methods.
*   **Directness:** The solution is straightforward and directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity.

**Weaknesses (or areas for minor stylistic consideration):**

*   **Loop Type:** While the `while` loop is perfectly functional and correct, a `for` loop with `range()` is often considered more "Pythonic" and compact for iterating over a known sequence of numbers. For example, `for i in range(1, 11):` inherently handles the initialization, condition, and increment in a single line. This is a stylistic preference rather than a functional weakness.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The program is already very good and achieves its goal effectively. The primary suggestion for improvement would be to use a `for` loop, which is often preferred in Python for definite iteration.

**Suggested Alternative (using a `for` loop):**

```python
from yogi import read

n = read(int)

# A 'for' loop is often preferred for iterating over a known range
for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11
    print(f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}')
```

This alternative achieves the exact same output with slightly more concise loop management. Given the simplicity of the problem, both the `while` loop and the `for` loop solutions are equally effective and easy to read.
