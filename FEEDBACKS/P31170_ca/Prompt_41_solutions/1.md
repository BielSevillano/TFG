**Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program**

**1. Summary of Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The submitted program solves this problem by first reading the integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then initializes a counter `i` to 1. A `while` loop is used to iterate as long as `i` is not equal to 11 (meaning `i` goes from 1 to 10). Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication expression `n * i` and its result, using `sep=''` in the `print` function to control spacing. Finally, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the logic to produce the multiplication table as specified. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional accuracy.
*   **Clarity:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand. The variable names `n` and `i` are standard for this type of problem.
*   **Controlled Output:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print` statement is a good practice to precisely control the spacing between elements, ensuring the output format is clean and consistent.
*   **Basic Looping:** It demonstrates a fundamental use of a `while` loop for iteration, which is a core programming concept.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Pythonic Looping:** While the `while` loop is functionally correct, iterating a fixed number of times (from 1 to 10) is more conventionally and idiomatically done in Python using a `for` loop with `range()`. A `for` loop often leads to more concise and readable code for such scenarios, as it handles the initialization and incrementing of the loop variable automatically.
*   **Loop Condition Readability:** The condition `while 11 != i:` is technically correct but `while i < 11:` or `while i <= 10:` might be slightly more intuitive for expressing "loop while `i` is less than or equal to 10." The use of a "magic number" (11) without further context can be a minor readability point, although in this simple case, it's fairly clear.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Prefer `for` loops for definite iteration:** For iterating a known number of times, Python's `for` loop with `range()` is generally more preferred. It is more concise and less prone to off-by-one errors or forgetting to increment the counter.

    *   **Example from reference solutions:**
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        n = read(int)
        for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11
            print(n, "*", i, " = ", n * i, sep='')
        ```

*   **Consider f-strings for output formatting:** For highly readable and efficient string formatting in modern Python, f-strings (formatted string literals) are an excellent choice. They often make print statements cleaner than concatenating or using `sep=''`.

    *   **Example from reference solutions:**
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        n = read(int)
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}')
        ```

*   **Encapsulate logic in a function (optional for small problems):** For better code organization and reusability, especially in larger programs, it's good practice to wrap the core logic within a function. For a problem this small, it's not strictly necessary, but it's a valuable habit.

    *   **Example from reference solutions:**
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        def taula_de_multiplicar(x):
            for i in range(1, 11):
                print(f'{x}*{i} = {x*i}')

        x = read(int)
        taula_de_multiplicar(x)
        ```

Overall, the program is a perfectly functional and correct solution to the problem, earning its "Accepted" status. The suggestions aim to introduce more Pythonic idioms and modern formatting techniques that can enhance readability and maintainability in larger projects.
