This feedback addresses the provided Python program for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem.

### Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (guaranteed to be between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. For example, if `n` is 2, the output should list `2*1=2` up to `2*10=20`.

The provided program reads the input integer into variable `a`. It then uses a `while` loop that iterates a counter `i` from 1 up to 10. In each iteration, it calculates the product `a*i` and prints the expression `a * i = a*i`.

### Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Logic:** The program correctly implements the core logic for calculating the multiplication table. It reads the input, iterates the correct number of times (1 to 10), and performs the multiplication accurately.
*   **Readability:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, using clear variable names (`a` for the input number, `i` for the multiplier) and a common loop structure.
*   **`easyinput` Usage:** It correctly uses `from easyinput import read` and `read(int)` to handle input as specified by the problem environment (Jutge.org).

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Output Formatting (Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly the precise formatting of the output. Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas, inserts a space between each argument by default.
    *   The current `print (a, "*", i, "=", a*i)` statement will produce output like: `2 * 1 = 2` (with spaces around the `*` and the `=`).
    *   Judging by common expectations in such problems and several reference solutions, the expected format is likely more compact, such as `2*1 = 2` (no spaces around the `*`, and exactly one space before and after the `=`). This minor discrepancy in spacing is often enough for an automated judge to mark the answer as incorrect.

### Suggestions for Improvement

The core logic of your program is sound; the main improvement needed is to fine-tune the output format.

1.  **Adjust Output Formatting:**
    To match the likely expected output format `n*i = result`, you can modify the `print` statement using one of the following methods:

    *   **Using `sep=""` with explicit spaces:**
        This approach explicitly removes the default spaces between arguments (`sep=""`) and then manually adds spaces where needed.
        ```python
        # Original: print (a, "*", i, "=", a*i)
        print(a, "*", i, " = ", a*i, sep="")
        ```
        This will output `2*1 = 2`.

    *   **Using an f-string (Formatted String Literal):**
        F-strings provide a very readable and flexible way to embed expressions inside string literals. This is generally the most recommended approach in modern Python.
        ```python
        # Original: print (a, "*", i, "=", a*i)
        print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}")
        ```
        This will also output `2*1 = 2`.

    *   **Using String Concatenation:**
        Explicitly convert numbers to strings and concatenate them.
        ```python
        # Original: print (a, "*", i, "=", a*i)
        print(str(a) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(a*i))
        ```
        This will also output `2*1 = 2`.

2.  **Consider a `for` loop (Pythonic style):**
    While your `while` loop is perfectly functional, for a fixed number of iterations (like 1 to 10), a `for` loop with `range()` is often considered more idiomatic and concise in Python.
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    a = read(int)

    # Using a for loop for fixed iterations
    for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}") # Example with f-string for formatting
    ```
