This program effectively solves the problem of printing a multiplication table for a given number.

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then displaying its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program addresses this by:
1.  Reading the input number `n` (stored in the variable `x`).
2.  Initializing a counter `d` to `1`.
3.  Using a `while` loop that continues as long as `d` is less than `11`.
4.  Inside the loop, it calculates the product of `x` and `d`, storing it in `a`.
5.  It then prints the formatted multiplication expression (`x * d = a`) using `sep=""` to ensure proper spacing.
6.  Finally, it increments `d` by `1` to move to the next multiplication factor.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and prints the multiplication table for the given input `n`, fulfilling all problem requirements. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
*   **Clear Logic:** The use of a `while` loop with a clear counter (`d`) makes the iteration process easy to follow.
*   **Output Formatting:** The `sep=""` argument in the `print` function is used effectively to prevent extra spaces between the elements, resulting in a clean and standard multiplication table output (e.g., `3*1 = 3` instead of `3 * 1 = 3`).
*   **Readability:** Variable names `x` (for the input number) and `d` (for the multiplier) are reasonably clear for a program of this size.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Unused Import:** The line `import math` is present, but the `math` module is not used anywhere in the program. This adds unnecessary code.
*   **Idiomatic Python:** While functionally correct, using a `while` loop to iterate a fixed number of times (from 1 to 10) is less common in Python than a `for` loop with `range()`. A `for` loop (`for d in range(1, 11):`) is generally considered more Pythonic, concise, and less prone to off-by-one errors for such iterations.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Unused Import:** Delete the line `import math` as it's not utilized by the program.
2.  **Use a `for` loop for Iteration:** Replace the `while` loop with a `for` loop using `range()` for more idiomatic and concise code.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    x = read(int)
    for d in range(1, 11): # More Pythonic for iterating a fixed number of times
        a = d * x
        print(x, '*', d, ' = ', a, sep="")
    ```
