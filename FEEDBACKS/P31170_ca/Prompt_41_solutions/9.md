### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its complete multiplication table (from `n*1` to `n*10`).

The submitted program addresses this by:
*   Reading the integer input `n` using `yogi.read()`.
*   Utilizing a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive) for the multiplier `c`.
*   Inside the loop, calculating the product `a * c`.
*   Printing each line of the multiplication table in the format `n*c = product` by concatenating strings.

**2. Code Analysis: Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly solves the problem as described, generating the multiplication table for the given input `n`.
*   **Clarity of Logic:** The use of a `for` loop to iterate through the multipliers (1 to 10) is a clear and appropriate approach for this problem.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is quite compact and achieves its goal in a minimal number of lines.
*   **Readability:** The core logic of reading input, looping, calculating, and printing is straightforward to follow.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Redundant Variable Initialization:** The variable `b` is initialized as an empty string (`b=""`). However, it is immediately reassigned to an integer (`a*c`) in the first iteration of the loop. This initial string assignment is redundant and could be removed without affecting the program's functionality.
*   **Variable Naming:** While functional, the variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` are not very descriptive. Using more meaningful names (e.g., `n` or `number` for `a`, `multiplier` or `i` for `c`, and `product` for `b`) would enhance code readability, especially for larger programs.
*   **String Formatting:** Using string concatenation (`+`) with explicit `str()` conversions (`str(a)+"*"+str(c)+" = "+ str(b)`) is a valid method but can sometimes be less readable or slightly less efficient than f-strings or `print()` with the `sep` argument in Python.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Remove Redundancy:** Eliminate the line `b=""`. The variable `b` can be defined directly inside the loop, or the product can be calculated and printed without storing it in an intermediate variable.

    *   *Example:*
        ```python
        # ...
        for c in range(1,11):
            product = a * c
            print(str(a)+"*"+str(c)+" = "+ str(product))
        ```
        Or even more directly:
        ```python
        # ...
        for c in range(1,11):
            print(str(a)+"*"+str(c)+" = "+ str(a*c))
        ```

*   **Improve Variable Names:** Adopt more descriptive variable names to make the code's purpose clearer at a glance.

    *   *Example:*
        ```python
        from yogi import read
        number = read(int) # Renamed 'a' to 'number'
        for multiplier in range(1,11): # Renamed 'c' to 'multiplier'
            product = number * multiplier # Renamed 'b' (implicitly) to 'product'
            print(str(number)+"*"+str(multiplier)+" = "+ str(product))
        ```

*   **Utilize Modern String Formatting:** Consider using f-strings (formatted string literals) for a more concise and readable way to construct the output string. Alternatively, the `print()` function's `sep` parameter can be used to control the separator between arguments.

    *   *Using f-strings (recommended):*
        ```python
        from yogi import read
        number = read(int)
        for multiplier in range(1,11):
            print(f"{number}*{multiplier} = {number * multiplier}")
        ```
    *   *Using `print()` with `sep=""` (also good):*
        ```python
        from yogi import read
        number = read(int)
        for multiplier in range(1,11):
            print(number, "*", multiplier, " = ", number * multiplier, sep="")
        ```

These suggested improvements aim to make the code more Pythonic, readable, and maintainable without changing its correct functionality.
