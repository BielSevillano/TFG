**Feedback: Taula de multiplicar**

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its "multiplication table." The submitted solution takes a direct and straightforward approach:
1.  It reads the input number `n` (stored in `nombre`).
2.  It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
3.  Inside the loop, it calculates the product of `nombre` and the current loop iterator `i`.
4.  Finally, it prints this calculated product.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The line `nombre = int(input())` correctly reads the integer input.
    *   **Correct Iteration Range:** The `for i in range (1, 11):` loop correctly covers the standard multiplication table values from 1 to 10.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** `multiple = nombre * i` correctly computes the product for each step.
    *   **Readability:** The code is very clean, concise, and easy to understand.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Output Format (Main Issue):** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is that the program only prints the *result* of the multiplication (`print(multiple)`), not the full expression that constitutes a "multiplication table" (e.g., `n * i = result`). Competitive programming platforms often require a precise output format, and in this case, the expected format is likely `[n] * [i] = [n*i]`.
    *   **Lack of `easyinput` (Minor/Contextual):** While `input()` works fine on standard Python environments, many competitive programming platforms (like Jutge.org, as seen in the reference solutions) use custom input modules like `easyinput.read()`. If the platform uses `easyinput`, then `input()` would fail or require a different setup, but for this specific problem context, the `Wrong Answer` is likely due to the output format rather than input method.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The main improvement needed is to adjust the `print` statement to match the expected output format of a multiplication table. Here are a few ways to achieve this:

1.  **Using `print` with `sep=''` (Recommended for direct control):**
    ```python
    nombre = int(input())
    for i in range (1, 11):
        multiple = nombre * i
        print(nombre, "*", i, " = ", multiple, sep='')
    ```
    This method ensures there are no default spaces between the printed items, giving precise control over the output.

2.  **Using an f-string (Modern Pythonic way):**
    ```python
    nombre = int(input())
    for i in range (1, 11):
        multiple = nombre * i
        print(f'{nombre}*{i} = {multiple}')
    ```
    F-strings are generally preferred for their readability and conciseness when formatting output.

3.  **Using string concatenation:**
    ```python
    nombre = int(input())
    for i in range (1, 11):
        multiple = nombre * i
        print(str(nombre) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(multiple))
    ```
    While functional, this is often less readable than f-strings or `print` with `sep=''`.

By implementing any of these changes to the `print` statement, the program should produce the correctly formatted output and pass the "Wrong Answer" test case.
