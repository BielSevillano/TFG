### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program solves this by first reading the input number `n` using `yogi.read(int)`. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers `i` from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it prints each line of the multiplication table in the format `n * i = n*i`.

**2. Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the required logic and produces the "Accepted" output, meaning it fulfills all problem requirements.
    *   **Clarity and Readability:** The variable names (`n`, `i`) are standard and intuitive for this problem. The loop structure is straightforward and easy to understand.
    *   **Conciseness:** The use of a `for` loop effectively generates all 10 lines of the table without repetitive code, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    *   **Precise Formatting:** The use of `sep=""` and `end=""` in the `print` statements demonstrates a good understanding of how to control output formatting in Python, ensuring no extra spaces are introduced where not desired.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Two `print` statements per line:** While effective, using two `print` statements (`print(..., end="")` followed by `print(...)`) for each line of output is less common and slightly less efficient than consolidating the entire line into a single `print` call.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Consolidate `print` statements:** For better readability and conciseness, you can combine the two `print` statements into one. The `sep=""` argument can be applied to all elements within a single `print` call, or you can use f-strings.

    *   **Using a single `print` with `sep=""`:**
        ```python
        n=read(int)
        for i in range(1,11):
            print(n, "*", i, " = ", i*n, sep="")
        ```
    *   **Using f-strings (recommended for modern Python):** F-strings offer a very clean and readable way to format output.
        ```python
        n=read(int)
        for i in range(1,11):
            print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    Both of these alternatives achieve the exact same output with potentially cleaner syntax.
