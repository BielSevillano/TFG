### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks to read an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program addresses this by reading the input `n` using `yogi.read`. It then uses a `while` loop that iterates `i` from 1 to 10, printing each line of the multiplication table in the format `n * i = n*i`.

**Code Analysis (Strengths and Weaknesses):**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program successfully reads the integer `n` using `yogi.read(int)`.
    *   **Logical Iteration:** The `while` loop is correctly implemented to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10, ensuring all required multiplication products are calculated.
    *   **Accurate Calculation:** The multiplication `n * i` is performed correctly for each step.
    *   **Clear and Understandable:** The code is straightforward and easy to follow, demonstrating a clear understanding of basic loop structures.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Primary Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The main issue that likely led to the "Wrong Answer" status is the exact output format. The `print` statement `print(n, "*", i, "=", n*i)` uses Python's default separator (a single space) between each argument. This results in an output like `N * I = R` (e.g., `2 * 3 = 6`).
        Competitive programming platforms often require a very precise output format. Based on common expectations and other successful solutions, the likely expected format is `N*I = R` (no spaces around the `*` operator, and a single space before and after the `=` operator). The extra spaces around the asterisk and potentially differing spacing around the equals sign would cause a mismatch with the expected output, leading to the "Wrong Answer."

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output Formatting (Recommended Fix):** To resolve the "Wrong Answer" and match the expected output format (`N*I = R`), you should explicitly control the spacing within your `print` statement.
    *   **Using f-strings (most Pythonic and readable):** This allows for precise control over string formatting.
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using the `sep` argument in `print`:** You can set the separator to an empty string and manually include spaces where needed.
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        This concatenates the arguments directly, then you explicitly add `" = "` for the desired spacing around the equals sign.

2.  **Consider a `for` loop for clarity:** While your `while` loop is functionally correct, a `for` loop with `range()` is often considered more idiomatic and concise in Python for iterating a fixed number of times.
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11): # Iterates from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

By implementing the output formatting correction, your program should produce the exact expected output and achieve a "Correct Answer" status.
