### Feedback: Taula de Multiplicar

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output format for each line should display `n * i = result`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program reads the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then initializes a counter `i` to 1 and uses a `while` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it prints each line of the multiplication table, calculating `n * i` and displaying it along with the operands. The `print` statements utilize `sep=""` and `end=" "` to control the spacing and ensure the output for each line appears on a single line.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly solves the problem. It accurately reads the input, performs the multiplication, and prints the table from 1 to 10. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
*   **Readability:** The variable names `n` and `i` are clear and commonly used conventions for number and iterator, respectively.
*   **Loop Control:** The `while` loop is implemented correctly, ensuring `i` iterates from 1 to 10 and increments properly.
*   **Output Control:** The use of `sep=""` and `end=" "` in the `print` statements demonstrates a good understanding of how to control print output for specific formatting requirements.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**
*   **Idiomatic Python (Loop Choice):** While the `while` loop is functionally correct, for iterating over a fixed, known range, a `for` loop with `range()` is generally considered more Pythonic and often more concise. Many of the other solutions provided use a `for` loop for this reason.
    *   Example from other solutions: `for i in range(1, 11):`
*   **Output Formatting with Multiple `print` calls:** Using two `print` statements (`print(n,"*", i ,sep="", end=" ")` and `print("=", (n*i))`) to form a single line of output can be less straightforward than using a single `print` statement. It requires careful management of the `end` parameter in the first `print` and the default `sep` in the second `print` (which adds a space between `=` and `n*i`).
    *   The `print("=", (n*i))` statement will introduce a default space between the `=` and the calculated result, e.g., " = 2" instead of "=2". While this might be acceptable for the problem's output, precise control is easier with a single statement.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Prefer `for` loop for fixed iterations:**
    Refactor the `while` loop into a `for` loop using `range(1, 11)`. This makes the code more concise and aligns with common Python idioms for such tasks.

    *   **Current:**
        ```python
        i=1
        while i<=10:
            # ...
            i=i+1
        ```
    *   **Suggested:**
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            # ...
        ```

2.  **Use a Single `print` Statement for Each Line:**
    Combine the output into a single `print` call. This reduces complexity and allows for more precise control over spacing. Two common ways to achieve this are:

    *   **Using `sep=""` for all elements:**
        ```python
        # Current logic's effective output: N*I = RESULT
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        This approach uses `sep=""` to join all elements without extra spaces, giving precise control.

    *   **Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals):**
        F-strings are a powerful and highly readable way to format strings in Python 3.6+.
        ```python
        print(f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}')
        ```
        This is often the most concise and clearest way to achieve the desired output.

**Example of Improved Code (combining suggestions):**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)

# Using a for loop and a single print with f-string
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}')

# Alternative using a for loop and single print with sep=""
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
```

These suggestions aim to make the code more Pythonic and maintainable, while still achieving the correct output. The current solution is functional and accepted, demonstrating a good grasp of basic programming concepts.
