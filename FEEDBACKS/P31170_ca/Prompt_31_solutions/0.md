### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its complete multiplication table from `n*1` to `n*10`. The submitted solution approaches this by reading the input `n` and then explicitly writing out ten separate `print` statements, each responsible for printing one line of the multiplication table.

**2. Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Calculations:** The program correctly calculates the product `n * i` for each `i` from 1 to 10.
    *   **Clear Intent:** For a very small and fixed number of operations, the code's intent is immediately clear: print each line of the multiplication table.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Repetitiveness and Lack of Scalability:** The primary weakness is the high degree of repetition. Using ten individual `print` statements makes the code verbose and inefficient. If the problem required the table up to, say, `n*100`, this approach would become extremely cumbersome and impractical. This is a missed opportunity to use a fundamental programming concept: loops.
    *   **Output Format Mismatch (Probable Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The most likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is a subtle mismatch in the output format. Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas (e.g., `print(n, "*1 =", n)`), inserts a space between each argument by default (i.e., `sep=' '`). This means the output would look like `N *1 = N`. Competitive programming problems usually require exact output matching, and often expect `N*I = RESULT` without extra spaces around the `*` and `=`, or specifically `N*I = RESULT`. Many reference solutions confirm this by explicitly setting `sep=''` or using f-strings for precise spacing.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Utilize Loops:** The most significant improvement would be to use a `for` loop (or `while` loop) to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10. This dramatically reduces code repetition, making it more concise, readable, and scalable.
    ```python
    # Example using a for loop
    for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        # ... print statement here ...
    ```

2.  **Control Output Spacing Precisely:** To resolve the output formatting issue, explicitly control how elements are separated in the `print` statement:
    *   **Using `sep=''` in `print()`:** This tells `print` not to insert any spaces between the arguments.
        ```python
        # Example with sep=''
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
    *   **Using f-strings (Recommended for modern Python):** F-strings provide a very clean and powerful way to embed expressions inside string literals, giving you full control over the output format.
        ```python
        # Example with f-strings
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```

By incorporating a loop and precisely controlling the output format, your program will become more robust, elegant, and will likely achieve the "Accepted" verdict.
