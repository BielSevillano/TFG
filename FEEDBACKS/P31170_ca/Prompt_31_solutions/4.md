### Feedback on "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The submitted program attempts to solve this by reading `n` using `yogi.read`, printing a header, and then using a `for` loop to iterate and print each multiplication step `n * i`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   The program correctly reads the integer input `n`.
    *   It uses a `for` loop, which is a suitable control structure for iterating a fixed number of times.
    *   The calculation `n * i` for the product is correct.

*   **Weaknesses (Reasons for "Wrong Answer"):**
    1.  **Unnecessary Header Output:** The line `print('taula de multiplicar', n)` prints a descriptive header before the actual table. This header is not part of the required output format and causes the program to produce extra lines, leading to a "Wrong Answer".
    2.  **Incorrect Loop Range:** The loop `for i in range(11)` iterates `i` from 0 up to 10 (inclusive). The problem specifies printing the multiplication table from 1 to 10. Including `n * 0 = 0` is incorrect according to the problem's requirements and deviates from the standard multiplication table.
    3.  **Output Formatting Inconsistency:** The default behavior of `print` with multiple arguments is to insert a space between each argument (e.g., `print(n, '*', i, '=', n*i)` will output `n * i = n*i`). The expected format for this problem (as seen in most correct solutions) typically has no spaces around the multiplication operator, like `n*i = product`. This subtle difference in spacing can also cause a "Wrong Answer" in automated grading systems.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the Header Line:** Delete the line `print('taula de multiplicar', n)`. The problem only asks for the table itself, not a descriptive title.
2.  **Adjust the Loop Range:** Change the `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. This can be done by modifying `range(11)` to `range(1, 11)`.
    *   **Example:** `for i in range(1, 11):`
3.  **Refine Output Formatting:** To achieve the standard output format (e.g., `2*1 = 2`), consider using an f-string or specifying the `sep` argument in the `print` function:
    *   **Using an f-string (recommended for clarity and control):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `sep=''` with `print` for precise control:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep='')
        ```
        This will produce the output `2*1 = 2`, where `n`, `*`, `i`, space, `=`, space, `n*i` are concatenated without extra spaces in between the specified parts.

By implementing these changes, your program will correctly adhere to the problem's output specifications and should pass the tests.
