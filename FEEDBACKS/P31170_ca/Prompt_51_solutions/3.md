**Feedback for Taula de multiplicar program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks to read an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program correctly approaches this by reading the input number `a` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then iterates from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop and, for each iteration, prints the multiplication `a * i` in a formatted way.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The program correctly reads the input number and uses a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)` to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10, which is precisely what the problem requires.
    *   **Accurate Calculation:** The product `a * i` is calculated correctly in each iteration.
    *   **Readability (Fundamental Structure):** The code is straightforward and easy to understand in terms of its overall flow.
    *   **`sep=''` Usage:** The explicit use of `sep=''` demonstrates an understanding of how to control separators in the `print` function, which can be useful for precise formatting.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Formatting Mismatch:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is a subtle but critical difference in the output formatting, specifically regarding spaces.
        The current `print` statement: `print(str(a), "*", str(i), "=", ' ', str(a*i), sep = '')`
        This results in an output like `2*1= 2` (no space before `=`, but one space after it).
        Most competitive programming judges expect a precise output format, typically with spaces around the equals sign, like `2*1 = 2`. The explicit `' '` argument *after* the `=` sign creates a space there, but one is missing *before* the `=` sign.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To fix the "Wrong Answer" and improve the code, focus on the output formatting:

1.  **Correct the Spacing:**
    The most direct fix is to adjust the arguments in the `print` statement to ensure the correct spacing around the equals sign. You need a space before and after the equals sign.

    *   **Current:** `print(str(a), "*", str(i), "=", ' ', str(a*i), sep = '')`
        *   Output example: `2*1= 2`
    *   **Suggested Change:** To match the expected format (e.g., `2*1 = 2`), you can modify the `print` statement to include the space before the equals sign either as part of the string or as a separate argument with `sep=''`.

    One common and robust way, seen in many successful solutions, is to integrate the spaces into a single string argument for the " = " part:
    ```python
    print(str(a), "*", str(i), " = ", str(a*i), sep = '')
    ```
    Or, if you prefer explicit arguments:
    ```python
    print(str(a), "*", str(i), ' ', "=", ' ', str(a*i), sep = '') # Adding a space before '='
    ```
    However, the more common and often preferred method to achieve `N * M = RESULT` with `sep=''` is:
    ```python
    print(str(a), "*", str(i), " = ", str(a*i), sep = '')
    ```
    This prints `N`, then `*`, then `M`, then ` = `, then `RESULT`, all concatenated without extra separators from `print`.

2.  **Consider Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals):**
    For cleaner and often more explicit control over string formatting, especially when mixing variables and fixed text, f-strings are highly recommended in modern Python.

    ```python
    print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}")
    ```
    This f-string directly embeds the variables `a`, `i`, and `a*i` into the desired string, ensuring the exact spacing `N*M = RESULT` without needing to manage `str()` conversions or `sep` arguments. This is generally considered a more Pythonic and readable approach for such output.

By implementing one of these formatting corrections, your program should pass the judge's test cases.
