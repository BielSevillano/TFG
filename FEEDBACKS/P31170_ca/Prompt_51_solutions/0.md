This feedback addresses your Python program for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem, which resulted in a "Wrong Answer."

### Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

The problem requires reading an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`.

Your program attempts to solve this by:
1.  Reading the integer `n` using `easyinput.read()`.
2.  Using a `for` loop to iterate through a sequence of numbers.
3.  Inside the loop, calculating the product `n * i`.
4.  Printing the multiplication expression and its result for each `i`.

### Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer `n` using `from easyinput import read`.
*   **Loop Structure:** Using a `for` loop is an appropriate and efficient approach to generate multiple lines of the multiplication table.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `n * i` is correctly performed.

**Weaknesses Leading to "Wrong Answer":**

1.  **Incorrect Loop Range:** The primary issue is `for i in range(10):`. In Python, `range(10)` generates numbers from `0` up to (but not including) `10`, meaning `0, 1, 2, ..., 9`.
    *   The problem asks for the multiplication table from `1` to `10`. Your current code incorrectly includes `n * 0` and completely omits `n * 10`. This directly leads to incorrect output values.

2.  **Output Formatting Inconsistency:** The `print` statement `print(str(n) + "*" + str(i), "=", n*i)` results in an output format like `N*I = RESULT` (e.g., `3*0 = 0`). The key here is the extra space automatically inserted by the `print` function between the argument `(str(n) + "*" + str(i))` and `"="`, and again between `"="` and `(n*i)`.
    *   While minor, online judges are often strict about exact output formatting. Most reference solutions achieve a format like `N*I = RESULT` (e.g., `3*1=3`) without the extra space before the equals sign. This subtle difference in spacing can also cause a "Wrong Answer" status.

### Suggestions for Improvement

To correct the program and achieve the expected output:

1.  **Fix the Loop Range:** Change the `range` in your `for` loop to `range(1, 11)`. This will make `i` iterate from `1` up to (but not including) `11`, ensuring it covers `1, 2, ..., 10`.

    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11): # Corrected range
        # ... rest of the code
    ```

2.  **Improve Output Formatting:** To ensure precise control over spacing and match common expected formats, use an f-string or `sep=""` in your `print` statement.

    *   **Using f-string (recommended for readability):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This creates a string where variables are directly embedded, giving you full control over spacing.

    *   **Using `sep=""` with `print`:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        By setting `sep=""`, you explicitly tell `print` not to add spaces between arguments. You then add the necessary spaces manually within the arguments (e.g., `" = "` has spaces around `=`).

Here's how the improved code would look:

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
for i in range(1, 11):  # Corrected range from 1 to 10
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Improved output formatting with f-string
```
