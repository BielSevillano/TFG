### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires generating and printing the multiplication table for a given integer `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 9. The program implements a straightforward solution: it reads the input `n`, then uses a `while` loop to iterate a counter `i` from 1 to 10. In each iteration, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints the multiplication expression along with its result.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Clear Logic:** The code is easy to understand and directly addresses the problem's requirements. It correctly identifies the need for a loop to generate the 10 multiplication steps.
    *   **Correct Iteration:** The `while(i <= 10)` loop correctly ensures that the multiplier `i` ranges from 1 to 10, covering all necessary steps of a standard multiplication table.
    *   **Accurate Calculation:** The `i*n` calculation is correct for each step.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Primary Issue causing "Wrong Answer"):** The main reason for the "Wrong Answer" result is almost certainly due to the output format. Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas (e.g., `print(n, '*', i, '=', i*n)`), inserts a space between each argument by default.
        *   This means the program produces output like: `2 * 1 = 2` (with spaces around the `*` and `=`).
        *   Most competitive programming platforms, including Jutge.org, expect a very specific output format, often without these extra spaces (e.g., `2*1 = 2` or `2*1 = 2`).
        *   Comparing with successful reference solutions, the expected format typically uses `sep=""` in `print()` or f-strings to control spacing precisely, usually resulting in `n*i = result` (no spaces around `*`, one space before and after `=`).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output Formatting:** This is the most critical improvement to achieve a "Correct" verdict.
    *   **Using `sep=""` in `print()`:** You can control the separator by explicitly setting `sep=""`. You'd then manually add spaces where desired.
        ```python
        # To match 'n*i = result' (common format)
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", i*n, sep="")
        ```
    *   **Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals):** This is often the most modern, readable, and flexible way to format strings in Python.
        ```python
        # To match 'n*i = result' (common format)
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **String Concatenation:** Explicitly build the string.
        ```python
        # To match 'n*i = result' (common format)
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(i*n))
        ```

2.  **Use a `for` loop for Fixed Iterations (Pythonic Style):** While your `while` loop is functionally correct, for iterating a fixed number of times over a known range, a `for` loop with `range()` is generally considered more Pythonic and often more concise.
    ```python
    # from yogi import read # or easyinput if preferred by the platform

    # n = read(int)

    # for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11
    #     # Use one of the improved print statements from above
    #     print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

The program's core logic is sound; addressing the precise output formatting will make it fully compliant with the problem's requirements.
