### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The program addresses the "Taula de multiplicar" problem, which requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.

The submitted solution effectively tackles this by first reading the input number using `easyinput.read(int)` and storing it in a variable named `a`. It then employs a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the product of `a` and the current loop counter `i`, storing this result in `b`. Finally, it prints the formatted multiplication expression (`a * i = b`) to the console.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The code accurately implements the problem's requirements, correctly generating and printing the multiplication table for the given input. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional accuracy.
    *   **Clarity:** The logic is straightforward and easy to follow. The use of a `for` loop for iteration and basic arithmetic operations is clear and understandable.
    *   **Conciseness:** The solution is quite compact, achieving the desired outcome with minimal lines of code.
    *   **Efficiency:** For this small-scale problem, the solution is very efficient, performing a fixed number of operations (input reading, 10 multiplications, 10 print statements).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting:** The program uses explicit string concatenation (`str(a) + "*" + str(i) + "=" + b`) for printing. While functional, this method can be verbose and requires manual conversion of numerical types to strings. Python offers more modern and readable ways to format output.
    *   **Variable Naming:** The variable names `a` and `b` are generic. While acceptable for a very small script, using more descriptive names like `n` (as in the problem description) or `number` for the input, and `product` or `result` for the calculated value, would significantly improve readability and maintainability for future reference or collaboration.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Utilize f-strings for Output (Recommended):** Python's f-strings (formatted string literals) provide a much cleaner and more readable way to format output. This is the most significant improvement for this code.
    Replace:
    ```python
    print(str(a) + "*" + str(i), "=", b)
    ```
    With:
    ```python
    print(f"{a}*{i} = {b}")
    ```
    This change automatically handles type conversions and clearly shows the desired output structure.

2.  **Enhance Variable Naming:** Adopting more descriptive variable names makes the code easier to understand at a glance.
    Consider renaming `a` to `n` (or `number`) and `b` to `product`.

    Example incorporating both suggestions:
    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int) # Renamed 'a' to 'n'

    for i in range(1, 11):
        product = n * i # Renamed 'b' to 'product'
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {product}") # Using f-string for output
    ```

3.  **Encapsulate Logic in a Function (Optional):** For better organization and reusability, especially as programs grow, it's good practice to wrap the core logic in a function. While not strictly necessary for this small problem, it's a valuable habit.
    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    def print_multiplication_table(number):
        for i in range(1, 11):
            product = number * i
            print(f"{number}*{i} = {product}")

    # Main execution block
    n_input = read(int)
    print_multiplication_table(n_input)
    ```

Overall, the program successfully solves the problem. The suggested improvements primarily focus on adopting more idiomatic Python practices for string formatting and enhancing code readability, which are beneficial for long-term maintainability.
