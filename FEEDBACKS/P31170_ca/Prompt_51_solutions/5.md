### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

This feedback analyzes the provided Python program designed to generate a multiplication table.

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`.

The provided program implements a direct and effective solution:
1.  It reads the integer `n` using the `easyinput` library.
2.  It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive), representing the multiplier `i`.
3.  Inside the loop, it calculates the product `s = n * i`.
4.  Finally, it prints the multiplication expression and its result in the format `n*i = s`.

**2. Code Analysis: Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly solves the problem as described, producing the multiplication table for the given input `n`. It was accepted by the system, indicating it meets all requirements.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very straightforward and easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`, `s`) are simple and contextually clear for this small problem.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is compact, achieving the task in just a few lines of code.
*   **Idiomatic Python:** The use of a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)` is the standard and most Pythonic way to perform this kind of iteration.
*   **Appropriate Library Usage:** It correctly utilizes `easyinput.read(int)` as expected in the Jutge.org environment.

**Weaknesses (Minor Refinements):**

*   **Output Formatting:** While functional and accepted, the way the output string is constructed (`str(n) + "*" + str(i), "=", s`) relies on `print`'s default behavior of adding a space between arguments. This results in an output like `2*3 = 6`. While this specific output might be acceptable, it's slightly less explicit in its formatting compared to more modern string formatting techniques. The concatenation `str(n) + "*" + str(i)` correctly avoids spaces for the `n*i` part, but the `=` and `s` arguments to `print` still get a default space.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

The core logic of the program is solid. The main area for minor improvement lies in refining the output formatting for better explicitness and often, more concise code.

*   **Use F-strings for clearer formatting:** F-strings (formatted string literals) provide a more modern, readable, and precise way to format output in Python.
    ```python
    # Current: print(str(n) + "*" + str(i),  "=", s)
    # Suggested:
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {s}")
    ```
    This removes the need for explicit `str()` conversions and clearly defines the entire output string with controlled spacing. Many of the reference solutions demonstrate this approach.

*   **Use `sep=""` in the `print` function:** If you prefer passing multiple arguments to `print`, you can control the separator character by setting `sep=""` to avoid default spaces. However, this is usually less readable for complex strings than f-strings.
    ```python
    # Suggested (alternative to f-string):
    print(n, "*", i, " = ", s, sep="")
    ```
    Note that this example includes spaces *within* the string literals like `" = "`, which is necessary to achieve the desired spacing `n*i = s`.

These suggestions are minor and do not alter the correctness of the program, but they contribute to writing more idiomatic and maintainable Python code, particularly in how output strings are handled.
