### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input number `nombre`, then using a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. In each iteration, it calculates the product `nombre * i` and prints this `multiple`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic for Calculation:** The program correctly identifies the need to iterate from 1 to 10 and accurately calculates `nombre * i` in each step. The `range(1, 11)` correctly generates numbers from 1 up to and including 10.
    *   **Clear Variable Naming:** `nombre` and `multiple` are descriptive for their roles.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Output Format (Primary Issue):** This is the main reason for the "Wrong Answer". The problem asks to write the "taula de multiplicar," which implies a specific format, typically `n * i = result`. Your program only prints the `result` (`multiple`) on each line. For example, if `n=5`, it outputs `5, 10, 15...` instead of `5*1 = 5, 5*2 = 10...`.
    *   **Input Method:** While `int(input())` might work in some environments, `Jutge.org` often requires `easyinput.read(int)` for reading input, as seen in many reference solutions. Using `input()` might lead to issues on the platform, although the `Wrong Answer` status usually points to output rather than input method failures unless the program crashes or times out.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format:** Modify the `print` statement to display the full multiplication expression. You can achieve this using f-strings (formatted string literals) or by providing multiple arguments to `print` along with the `sep` parameter.

    *   **Using f-string:**
        ```python
        print(f"{nombre}*{i} = {multiple}")
        ```
    *   **Using multiple print arguments with `sep`:**
        ```python
        print(nombre, "*", i, " = ", multiple, sep="")
        ```
    This will produce the expected output, for example: `5*1 = 5`.

2.  **Adopt Platform-Specific Input (Recommended for Jutge.org):** To ensure compatibility with `Jutge.org`, it's best practice to use `easyinput`.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    nombre = read(int)
    # ... rest of your code
    ```

By implementing these suggestions, your program will likely pass the tests.
