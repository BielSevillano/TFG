**Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program**

This is an excellent solution for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem.

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`.
The provided solution effectively tackles this by first reading the integer `n` using `easyinput.read`. It then employs a `for` loop that iterates 10 times (from `i=0` to `i=9`). Inside the loop, it calculates `n * (i + 1)` and prints the full multiplication expression and its result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and displays the multiplication table for the given `n`, as confirmed by the "Accepted" status.
    *   **Efficiency:** Using a `for` loop is the most efficient and Pythonic way to generate a sequence of repetitive outputs like a multiplication table. This approach is superior to hardcoding each line (as seen in the reference solution) because it avoids repetition and is much more maintainable and scalable.
    *   **Readability:** The code is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`) are appropriate.
    *   **Scalability:** If the requirement were to print the table up to `n * 100`, only the `range(10)` value would need to be changed, demonstrating excellent scalability.
    *   **Input Handling:** Correctly uses `easyinput.read(int)` for the specified input environment.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Minor):** While "Accepted," the default `print` behavior when separating arguments with commas (`print(str(n) + "*" + str(i + 1), "=", n*(i + 1))`) automatically adds spaces between them. This results in output like `3 * 1 = 3` instead of the more standard `3*1 = 3`. This is a very minor aesthetic point and doesn't affect correctness.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Refine Output Formatting:** To achieve an output format without the extra spaces (e.g., `3*1 = 3`), you can use an f-string or explicitly control the separator in the `print` function:
    *   **Using f-string (recommended for modern Python):**
        ```python
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"{n}*{i + 1} = {n * (i + 1)}")
        ```
    *   **Using `sep=''` with `print` (similar to the reference solution's formatting):**
        ```python
        for i in range(10):
            print(n, "*", i + 1, " = ", n * (i + 1), sep='')
        ```
        *(Note: The `sep=''` approach can be slightly less readable than f-strings for complex output, but it achieves the precise spacing.)*

2.  **Make Loop Range More Explicit (Optional):** Instead of `range(10)` and then using `i + 1`, you could directly define the range from 1 to 10:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11): # Loops from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n * i}")
    ```
    This can sometimes make the loop's purpose slightly clearer as it directly corresponds to the multiplication factors.

Overall, this is a highly effective and well-structured solution. The minor formatting point is purely aesthetic and doesn't detract from the code's robust logic and design.
