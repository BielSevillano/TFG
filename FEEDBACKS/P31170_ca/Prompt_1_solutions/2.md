### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program to display the multiplication table for a given natural number `n` (between 1 and 9). The provided solution reads the integer `n` from input using `easyinput.read` and then attempts to generate the table using a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to 9. Each line of the table is constructed by concatenating `n`, `*`, the current iterator `i`, `=`, and the product `n*i`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
    *   **Efficient Loop Usage:** Employing a `for` loop (`for i in range(10):`) is an excellent and efficient approach to generate repetitive output like a multiplication table. This is far superior to manually writing each `print` statement, as seen in some alternative solutions, and demonstrates good programming practice for iteration.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The `n*i` calculation within the loop is logically correct for each multiplication step.

*   **Weaknesses (Reasons for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Incorrect Loop Range:** The `range(10)` function generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 10, meaning `i` will take values `0, 1, 2, ..., 9`. Standard multiplication tables typically start from `n*1` and go up to `n*10`. Your current output will include `n*0` and miss `n*10`.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The way the `print` statement is constructed (`str(n) + "*" + str(i), "=", n*i`) uses a mix of string concatenation (`+`) and `print` arguments separated by commas. By default, `print` adds a space between arguments separated by commas. This results in output like `5*1 = 5` (with spaces around the equals sign). Automated judges often expect an exact output format, typically `5*1=5` (without the extra spaces). This discrepancy in spacing is a very common reason for "Wrong Answer".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust the Loop Range:** To generate the multiplication table from 1 to 10, modify the `range` function:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11): # This will iterate i from 1 up to (but not including) 11, i.e., 1 through 10.
        # ... rest of your code
    ```

2.  **Refine Output Formatting:** To ensure the output matches the typical expected format (e.g., `5*1=5`), you can use one of these methods:

    *   **Using f-strings (Recommended for modern Python):** This is the most readable and concise way to embed expressions within strings.
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i}={n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `print` with `sep=''`:** The `sep=''` argument tells `print` not to put any separator between its arguments.
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, "=", n*i, sep='')
        ```
    *   **Explicit String Concatenation:** Concatenate all parts into a single string before printing. This requires converting all non-string parts (`n`, `i`, `n*i`) to strings explicitly.
        ```python
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + "=" + str(n*i))
        ```

By addressing the loop range and the output formatting, your program will likely produce the exact output expected by the judge. Your core logic for using a loop is excellent and a strong foundation for solving this problem!
