**Feedback for "Taula de Multiplicar" Program**

This program successfully solves the "Taula de multiplicar" problem, which requires reading a natural number `n` (guaranteed to be between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

**1. Solution Approach:**

The solution adopts an iterative approach. It first reads the input integer `n` using `yogi.read()`. It then initializes a counter `i` to `1`. A `while` loop is used to iterate `i` from 1 up to (and including) 10. Inside the loop, the program calculates the product `n * i`, and then prints the result in the specified format (`n*i = result`) using an f-string. The counter `i` is incremented in each iteration until it reaches `11`, at which point the loop terminates.

**2. Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness and Reliability:** The program correctly computes and displays the multiplication table as required by the problem statement, as confirmed by its "Accepted" status.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`, `resultado`) are descriptive, and the logic of the `while` loop is straightforward. The use of f-strings for output formatting (`F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}"`) is excellent for readability and conciseness.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of a loop makes the solution highly efficient and avoids code repetition, which would be present in a solution using multiple, individual `print` statements (like the reference solution).
*   **Maintainability and Scalability:** Should the requirement change (e.g., printing the table up to 20 instead of 10), only a single change to the loop condition (`while i < 21:`) would be needed, demonstrating good design.

**Weaknesses (Minor):**

*   **Pythonic Style (Minor):** While perfectly functional, a `while` loop is used here. For definite iterations (where you know the start and end points of a loop), a `for` loop combined with Python's `range()` function is generally considered more idiomatic, concise, and often less prone to off-by-one errors in initialisation/incrementation.
*   **"Magic Number" (Minor):** The number `11` in the `while i < 11:` condition is a "magic number." For this simple case, its meaning is obvious (loop until 10), but in more complex programs, it's often good practice to assign such numbers to a named constant for improved clarity and easier modification.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Adopt a `for` loop with `range()`:** The most significant and recommended improvement would be to refactor the loop to use a `for` loop with `range()`. This simplifies the code by implicitly handling the initialization and incrementation of the counter.

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)

    # Iterates i from 1 up to 10 (inclusive)
    for i in range(1, 11): 
        resultado = n * i
        print(F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}")
    ```

*   **Consider a Named Constant (Optional):** For even greater clarity and maintainability, especially if the upper limit of the multiplication table were subject to change, you could define a constant:

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    MAX_MULTIPLIER = 10 # Clearly defines the upper limit

    for i in range(1, MAX_MULTIPLIER + 1): 
        resultado = n * i
        print(F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}")
    ```

**Conclusion:**

This is a well-implemented and effective solution that correctly addresses the problem requirements. It demonstrates a good understanding of iterative structures and efficient output formatting in Python. The current solution is significantly superior in terms of structure and scalability compared to solutions relying on multiple, separate `print` statements. Incorporating a `for` loop with `range()` would make it even more Pythonic and robust.
