This feedback addresses your program for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem.

### Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

The problem asks you to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table. Your program approaches this by:
1.  Reading the input number `n`.
2.  Printing an introductory line: "taula de multiplicar n".
3.  Using a `for` loop that iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 10`.
4.  Inside the loop, it prints each multiplication line in the format `n*i=n*i`.

### Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Input Reading:** You correctly use `yogi.read` to get the integer input `n`.
*   **Looping for Repetitive Task:** Using a `for` loop is an excellent and efficient way to generate the multiple lines of a multiplication table, avoiding repetitive code.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The expression `n*i` correctly calculates each product.
*   **Output Formatting (`sep=''`):** Using `sep=''` in the `print` statement effectively concatenates the elements without extra spaces, which often matches the expected compact format in programming challenges.

**Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**

The "Wrong Answer" status is likely due to two common issues in competitive programming:

1.  **Incorrect Range for the Table:** Your loop `for i in range(11)` iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 10`. Standard multiplication tables typically start from `n * 1`. The inclusion of `n * 0` (which is `0`) and potentially the upper limit being different from what's expected can cause mismatches. The common expectation for "taula de multiplicar" is usually from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.
2.  **Unexpected Output Line:** The line `print('taula de multiplicar', n)` is an extra introductory line that is probably not expected as part of the strict output format. Competitive programming platforms often require an exact match to the specified output, including the absence of any additional text.

### Suggestions for Improvement

Based on the weaknesses and common problem requirements:

1.  **Adjust the Loop Range:** To align with the standard multiplication table (1 to 10), modify your `range` function.
    *   **Current:** `for i in range(11):` (produces `0, 1, ..., 10`)
    *   **Suggested:** `for i in range(1, 11):` (will produce `1, 2, ..., 10`)

2.  **Remove Extraneous Output:** Eliminate any output that is not explicitly requested.
    *   **Remove this line:** `print('taula de multiplicar', n)`

By making these two small adjustments, your program should produce the expected output for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem. It's crucial in competitive programming to pay close attention to the exact range and format of the required output.
