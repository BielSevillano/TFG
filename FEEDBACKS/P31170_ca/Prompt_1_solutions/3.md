This program provides an excellent and concise solution to the "Taula de multiplicar" problem.

### Problem and Solution Approach

The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table, showing the products of `n` with numbers from 1 to 10.

The provided program effectively solves this by first taking the integer input `n`. It then utilizes a `for` loop to iterate through the integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive), represented by the variable `i`. In each iteration, it calculates the product `m = n * i` and prints the entire expression `n * i = m` to the console. The `sep=""` argument in the `print` function ensures that there are no unwanted spaces between the elements, matching the typical output format for multiplication tables.

### Code Analysis

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The code correctly computes and displays the multiplication table for any given `n` within the specified range (and beyond).
    *   **Readability:** It is very clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The variable names (`n`, `i`, `m`) are appropriate and contribute to its clarity.
    *   **Efficiency:** For a small number of iterations (10), the loop is highly efficient and performs optimally with minimal computational overhead.
    *   **Pythonic Loop Usage:** The use of `for i in range(1, 11, 1)` is a standard and effective way to handle repetitive tasks in Python, demonstrating a good grasp of fundamental control flow. This approach is highly scalable; if the table needed to go up to 100, only a minor change to the `range` would be required, unlike the reference solution which would necessitate many more lines of code.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The `sep=""` argument in the `print` function correctly ensures that there are no extraneous spaces between the elements in the output (e.g., `5*1 = 5` instead of `5 * 1 = 5`), meeting typical formatting expectations for this problem.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   There are no significant weaknesses in this program that impede its functionality, correctness, or performance. Any suggestions below are purely stylistic or for minor conciseness improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Simplify `range` function:** The `step` argument of `1` in `range(1, 11, 1)` is the default behavior. For conciseness, you can omit it and simplify the line to:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):
    ```
2.  **Consider f-strings for output:** While `sep=""` works perfectly, modern Python often favors f-strings (formatted string literals) for building output strings due to their enhanced readability and flexibility. You could rewrite the print statement as:
    ```python
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {m}")
    ```
    This achieves the exact same output with potentially clearer syntax for some developers, as it keeps the entire string construction within one literal.

In conclusion, this is a well-structured, correct, and efficient solution that effectively leverages Python's looping constructs. It is a robust and scalable approach, far superior to solutions that would hardcode each print statement (like the reference example), making it highly maintainable and adaptable to future changes.
