### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that reads a single integer `n` (guaranteed to be between 1 and 9, inclusive) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The submitted program attempts to solve this by:
*   Reading the integer `n` using `easyinput.read()`.
*   Including an `if` statement to check if `n` is within a certain range.
*   Using a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
*   Inside the loop, calculating the product `n * i` and printing the multiplication expression and its result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly uses `easyinput.read(int)` to read the integer input `n`.
*   **Correct Iteration:** The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop correctly iterates through the multipliers from 1 to 10, as required for a multiplication table.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The product `n * i` is calculated correctly.
*   **Readability:** The code is generally clear and easy to understand.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Input Validation Logic (Critical Flaw):** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is likely the `if 1<n<10:` condition. The problem states that `n` is "entre 1 i 9" (between 1 and 9), which typically implies inclusivity (i.e., `1 <= n <= 9`). Your condition `1 < n < 10` is *strictly* between 1 and 10, meaning it excludes `n=1` and `n=9`. If the input `n` is 1 or 9, the `if` condition will evaluate to `False`, and the program will not print anything, leading to a "Wrong Answer" because output is expected for these valid inputs.
*   **Potential for Redundant Validation:** In competitive programming contexts like Jutge.org, input is generally guaranteed to adhere to the specified constraints. Therefore, an explicit `if` check for `n`'s validity might be unnecessary if you trust the problem's guarantees. While defensive programming is good, this specific `if` statement is not just redundant but actively incorrect due to its bounds.
*   **Output Formatting (Minor):** While functional, the default `print()` function adds spaces between arguments. The implicit requirements of platforms like Jutge.org often demand precise output formatting (e.g., no extra spaces). The reference solution uses `sep=''` which suggests a tighter formatting might be expected (e.g., `n*1 = n*1` instead of `n * 1 = n * 1`).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Input Validation Logic:** This is the most crucial fix. Change the `if` condition to correctly include `n=1` and `n=9`:
    ```python
    if 1 <= n <= 9:
        # ... your loop code here
    ```
2.  **Consider Removing the Validation (Recommended for this problem type):** Given the problem statement guarantees `n` will be between 1 and 9 (inclusive), the `if` statement can be removed entirely. The program would then directly proceed to print the multiplication table for any `n` read, assuming `n` is always valid as per the problem description. This aligns with the approach of the reference solution.

    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        s = n*i
        print(n, "*", i,  "=", s)
    ```
3.  **Improve Output Formatting (If strict formatting is an issue):** To ensure exact spacing, especially if the platform is strict about output format, you can use f-strings or the `sep` parameter in `print`:
    *   Using an f-string:
        ```python
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {s}")
        ```
    *   Using `sep=''`:
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, "=", s, sep='')
        ```
        (Note: The reference solution uses `sep=''` for parts of the string, which results in `n*1 = n*1`, so you might want to match that if it's a requirement: `print(n, "*", i, " = ", s, sep='')` or `print(f"{n}*{i} = {s}")`)

By addressing the incorrect `if` condition (or removing it as it's guaranteed input), your program should correctly pass all test cases.
