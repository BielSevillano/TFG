### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided solution effectively addresses this by:
1.  Reading the input integer `n` using `yogi.read`.
2.  Utilizing a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
3.  Inside the loop, printing each line of the multiplication table in the format `n * i = result`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly computes and displays the multiplication table for the given input `n`, from `n*1` to `n*10`. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
*   **Readability:** The code is very clear and easy to understand. The use of a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)` is idiomatic Python for iterating a fixed number of times.
*   **Conciseness:** It achieves the desired outcome with a minimal amount of code, which is good for competitive programming contexts.
*   **Precise Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=""` in the first `print` statement effectively removes default spaces between the arguments, and `end=""` prevents a newline character, allowing the second `print` call to append the result on the same line. This ensures the output matches the typical expected format without extra spaces.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Slightly verbose printing:** While functionally correct and precise, using two `print` statements (`print(n,"*",i," = ",sep="",end="")` and `print(i*n)`) to construct a single line of output is slightly less concise than alternative methods. This is a minor point, as the current implementation achieves the desired format perfectly.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The current code is already very good and fully functional for the problem. However, here are a couple of stylistic improvements for even greater conciseness and common Pythonic practice:

1.  **Consolidate Print Statements:** The two `print` statements can be combined into a single one by including the calculated result directly and using `sep=""` for the entire line:

    ```python
    from yogi import read
    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", i*n, sep="") # Combines into one print statement
    ```
    This approach is common in many of the reference solutions and is generally preferred for its clarity and brevity when constructing a formatted string from multiple parts.

2.  **Utilize f-strings (Formatted String Literals):** For string formatting, f-strings are often considered the most modern, readable, and efficient approach in Python 3.6+:

    ```python
    from yogi import read
    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Uses an f-string for formatting
    ```
    This provides an even cleaner way to embed variables directly into the output string without needing to manage `sep` or `end` arguments explicitly for basic formatting.

In summary, the program is well-written and correctly solves the problem with good readability and efficiency. The suggested improvements are primarily stylistic, aimed at adopting more concise and modern Python string formatting techniques.
