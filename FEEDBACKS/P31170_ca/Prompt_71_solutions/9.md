**Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program**

**1. Brief summary of the problem and the solution approach:**
The problem requires reading an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input `n`, then using a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 (representing the multiplicands), and printing each line of the multiplication table.

**2. Analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer `n` using `from easyinput import read` and `n=read(int)`.
    *   **Loop Iteration:** The `for i in range (1, 11):` loop correctly iterates through the desired range of multiplicands (from 1 up to and including 10).
    *   **Output Formatting (Partial):** The use of `sep=""` in the `print` statement is effective for concatenating the output elements without extra spaces, which is often crucial for matching exact output formats in competitive programming. The string literals `"*"` and `" = "` are also correctly placed.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Calculation:** The critical flaw in the program lies in the calculation within the `print` statement. Instead of calculating `n * i` (the input number multiplied by the current loop counter), it incorrectly calculates `i * 2`. This means the program will always output the multiplication table of 2, regardless of what `n` was read, leading to the "Wrong Answer" result.

**3. Suggestions for improvement:**
The primary issue is a simple but significant error in the arithmetic operation. To fix this:

*   **Correct the Multiplication:** Change `i*2` to `n*i` in your `print` statement. This will ensure that the program correctly calculates and displays the product of the input number `n` and the current multiplier `i`.

**Corrected Line:**
`print (n,"*",i," = ", n*i, sep="")`

Implementing this change will resolve the "Wrong Answer" and make the program correctly produce the multiplication table for any given `n`.
