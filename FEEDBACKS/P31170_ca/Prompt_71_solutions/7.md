### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its complete multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`. The student's program correctly approaches this by first reading the input number `n`. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the product `n * i` and attempts to print the multiplication expression along with its result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The fundamental logic for generating a multiplication table is sound. The program correctly reads the input, uses a loop to cover the required range (1 to 10), and performs the correct multiplication operation in each step.
    *   **Clear and Readable:** The variable names (`n`, `i`, `s`) are intuitive, making the code easy to understand at a glance.
    *   **Appropriate Loop Range:** `range(1, 11)` is correctly used to generate numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11, effectively covering 1 through 10.
    *   **Uses `easyinput`:** The program correctly uses the specified `easyinput` module for reading integer input.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Formatting:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly due to subtle differences in the output format, specifically the spacing. When using `print()` with multiple arguments separated by commas (e.g., `print(n, "*", i, "=", s)`), Python's `print` function defaults to inserting a single space character (`' '`) between each argument.
        For an input like `n=2`, the current code would produce lines such as:
        `2 * 1 = 2` (notice the spaces around `*` and `=`).

        However, competitive programming platforms often expect a very precise output format. Based on common practice and other successful solutions for this problem (which often use `sep=""` or f-strings), the expected output format likely has different spacing, for example:
        `2*1 = 2` (no space around `*`, a single space around `=`).

        Even a single extra or missing space can lead to a "Wrong Answer" on an automated judge. The core calculation and iteration are correct, but the exact string representation printed to standard output deviates from what is expected.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The key improvement needed is to meticulously control the output formatting to match the judge's exact requirements.

*   **Option 1: Using `sep=""` in `print()` (Recommended for this problem):**
    This allows you to concatenate the elements without automatic spaces, and you can explicitly add spaces as part of your string literals.
    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11):
        s = n * i
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", s, sep="") # ' = ' has its own spaces
    ```
    This modification would produce output like `2*1 = 2`, which is a common and usually accepted format.

*   **Option 2: Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**
    F-strings offer a very clean and readable way to embed expressions directly into string literals, giving you full control over formatting.
    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11):
        # s = n * i # 's' variable is optional here
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Directly embed calculation and control spacing
    ```
    This would also produce `2*1 = 2`.

*   **Option 3: Explicit String Concatenation:**
    This approach is more verbose but also gives precise control.
    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11):
        s = n * i
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(s))
    ```
    This would also yield `2*1 = 2`.

By implementing one of these formatting suggestions, the program should produce the exact output required by the judge and pass the "Wrong Answer" verdict. The current code is conceptually correct; it just needs a small adjustment in its presentation layer.
