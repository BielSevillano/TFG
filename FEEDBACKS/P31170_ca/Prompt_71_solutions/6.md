**Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program**

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The provided program solves this problem by first reading the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then uses a `for` loop that iterates through numbers `i` from 1 to 10 (achieved with `range(1, 11)`). Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints the result in the specified format (`n*i = n*i`) using an f-string.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and displays the multiplication table for the given input `n`, adhering to the problem's requirements. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very straightforward and easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`) are conventional and immediately indicate their purpose.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is compact and efficient, achieving the desired outcome with minimal lines of code.
*   **Modern Pythonic Approach:** The use of f-strings (`f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}'`) for output formatting is a modern and highly readable Pythonic practice, offering clear control over the string structure without needing multiple arguments or `sep` parameters.
*   **Appropriate Looping:** The `for i in range(1, 11)` construct is the idiomatic and most suitable way to iterate through a fixed sequence of numbers in Python for this kind of problem.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Wildcard Import (`from easyinput import*`):** While functional, using `import *` (wildcard import) is generally discouraged in Python. It can make it harder to trace where specific functions (like `read`) come from and can lead to potential name collisions in larger projects. For this small script, the impact is minimal, but it's a practice to be mindful of.
*   **Dead Code:** The commented-out line `#print (n,"*",i,"=",n*i)` is dead code. While harmless, it indicates remnants of development that could be cleaned up in a final version.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Specific Import:** Change `from easyinput import*` to `from easyinput import read`. This is a minor but better practice as it explicitly states what is being imported from the `easyinput` module, improving clarity and preventing potential name clashes.
*   **Remove Dead Code:** Delete the commented-out print statement. Keeping only active and relevant code improves maintainability and cleanliness.
*   **Optional: Encapsulation in a Function:** For slightly larger programs or to promote modularity, the logic could be wrapped within a function (e.g., `def print_multiplication_table(n): ...`). While not strictly necessary for this very small script, it's a good habit for structuring code. Many of the reference solutions demonstrate this approach.
