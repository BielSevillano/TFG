### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem "Taula de multiplicar" requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (guaranteed to be between 1 and 9, inclusive) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the integer `n`, checking if `n` is within a specific range, and if so, using a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n*i` and prints the expression `n*i = result`.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads an integer input using `easyinput.read(int)`.
    *   **Loop Structure:** It uses a `for` loop (`for i in range(1, 11):`) which is an appropriate and efficient way to iterate from 1 to 10 for the multiplication table.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The product `n*i` is calculated correctly.
    *   **General Logic:** The overall logic for generating a multiplication table is sound.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Validation/Filtering (Primary Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The condition `if 1 < n < 10:` is the main issue. The problem statement specifies that `n` will be "entre 1 i 9" (between 1 and 9, inclusive). This means valid inputs include `n=1` and `n=9`. However, the condition `1 < n < 10` evaluates to `False` for `n=1` (because `1 < 1` is false). Consequently, if the input `n` is `1`, the program does not enter the `if` block, and therefore prints nothing, leading to a "Wrong Answer". Since the problem guarantees `n` will be within this range, this `if` check is entirely unnecessary and harmful.
    *   **Output Formatting (Minor):** The `print(str(n) + "*" + str(i), "=", s)` statement mixes string concatenation and comma-separated arguments. This results in an extra space before the `=` sign (e.g., `2*1  = 2` instead of `2*1 = 2`), due to the `print` function's default `sep=' '` behavior between arguments. While this might pass some test cases, it can lead to "Wrong Answer" if the output format is strictly checked for spacing.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the unnecessary `if` condition:** Since the problem statement guarantees that `n` will always be between 1 and 9 (inclusive), the `if 1 < n < 10:` condition should be removed entirely. The loop should execute for any valid input `n` without this extra check.

    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int)
    # No if statement needed here
    for i in range(1, 11):
        s = n*i
        # ... print statement ...
    ```

2.  **Improve Output Formatting:** To ensure precise spacing and avoid unintended extra spaces, use f-strings or specify the `sep` argument in `print`.

    *   **Using f-strings (recommended for cleaner syntax):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {s}")
        ```
    *   **Using `sep=""` with `print`:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", s, sep="")
        ```
    Both of these will produce the expected format like `N*I = RESULT`.

By implementing these suggestions, particularly removing the erroneous `if` condition, the program will correctly handle all valid inputs and likely achieve a "Correct Answer" status.
