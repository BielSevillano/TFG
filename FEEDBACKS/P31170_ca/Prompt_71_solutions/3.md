### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Summary of Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires a program to read a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`. The provided solution correctly addresses this by reading the input `n` using `easyinput.read()`, and then employing a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it constructs and prints each line of the multiplication table.

**Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correctness:** The program successfully calculates and outputs the correct multiplication table for the specified range (1 to 10). The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness according to the problem's requirements.
2.  **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very straightforward and easy to understand. The variable names (`n`, `i`) are standard, and the loop logic is clear.
3.  **Conciseness:** The solution is minimal and efficient, achieving the desired outcome in just a few lines of code.
4.  **Appropriate Loop Structure:** Using `for i in range(1, 11)` is the ideal Pythonic way to iterate through a fixed sequence of numbers in this context.

**Weaknesses:**
1.  **Output Formatting:** The primary area for improvement lies in the output formatting. The `print()` statement uses a mix of string concatenation (`str(n)+'*'+str(i)`) and comma-separated arguments (`'=', n*i`). This results in an extra space before the equals sign due to how `print()` automatically inserts spaces between comma-separated items. For example, if `n` is 5 and `i` is 3, the output would be `5*3  = 15` (two spaces between `3` and `=`), rather than the more standard `5*3 = 15` (one space) or `5 * 3 = 15` (spaces around `*`). While technically "Accepted," consistent and precise formatting is good practice.
2.  **Wildcard Import (`from easyinput import *`):** While acceptable for small scripts, it's generally considered better practice to import specific functions (e.g., `from easyinput import read`) rather than using `*` (wildcard import). This improves code clarity by explicitly showing which names are being used from the module and helps avoid potential naming conflicts.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Refine Output Formatting:** To achieve precise control over the output spacing, consider using f-strings or the `sep` argument in the `print()` function:
    *   **Using f-strings (recommended for modern Python):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This would produce output like `5*3 = 15`.
    *   **Using `sep=""` with `print()`:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        This would also produce `5*3 = 15` by removing the default spaces that `print()` adds between arguments.
    *   **Pure string concatenation:**
        ```python
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n*i))
        ```
        This also yields `5*3 = 15`.

2.  **Specific Import:** Change the import statement to specifically bring in the `read` function:
    ```python
    from easyinput import read
    ```

Implementing these suggestions would make the code more robust in its output formatting and align it with general Python best practices, without sacrificing its current clarity or conciseness.
