### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and printing its complete multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output format for each line is typically `N*I = RESULT`.

**Solution Approach:**
The program attempts to solve the problem by reading the input `n` using `yogi.read(int)`. It then uses a `while` loop that iterates with a counter `i` from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates `n*i` and prints the expression `n`, `*`, `i`, `=`, and the result.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer input `n` using `yogi.read(int)`, which is appropriate for the Jutge.org environment.
    *   **Correct Loop Logic:** The `while` loop is correctly structured to iterate `i` from 1 to 10, ensuring all necessary multiplication facts are covered.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `i*n` is performed accurately.
    *   **Clear Variable Names:** Variable names like `n` and `i` are standard and easy to understand in this context.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Formatting:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" status is likely due to incorrect output formatting. The `print()` function in Python, when given multiple arguments separated by commas, automatically inserts a space between each argument by default.
        *   For example, `print(n, '*', i, '=', i*n)` will produce output like `2 * 1 = 2` (with spaces around the `*` and `=`).
        *   Jutge.org problems often have strict output format requirements, and the expected format for this problem is typically `N*I = RESULT` (e.g., `2*1 = 2`), with no spaces around the `*` and exactly one space before and after the `=`.
    *   **Unused Import:** The line `from tkinter import N` is present but unused. While not causing a functional error, it's unnecessary and can clutter the code.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output Formatting:**
    *   The most recommended way to achieve precise output formatting in Python is using **f-strings**. Modify the `print` statement inside the loop as follows:
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This ensures that there are no spaces around the `*` and a single space around the `=`.
    *   Alternatively, you could use the `sep=''` argument in the `print` function and explicitly add the space around the `=`:
        ```python
        print(n, '*', i, ' = ', i*n, sep='')
        ```

2.  **Remove Unused Import:** Delete the line `from tkinter import N`.

3.  **Consider a `for` loop (Optional, for style):** For iterating a fixed number of times (like 1 to 10), a `for` loop with `range()` is often considered more Pythonic and concise:
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

By implementing the suggested formatting change, your program will likely pass the output format requirements and achieve a "Correct Answer" status.
