### Feedback on "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks you to write a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its full multiplication table, from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`.

Your solution takes a direct and appropriate approach: it reads the input `n` using `easyinput`, then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and attempts to print each line of the multiplication table.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** You correctly use `from easyinput import read` and `n = read(int)` to get the integer input, which is standard for this environment.
    *   **Correct Iteration:** The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop correctly iterates from 1 to 10, ensuring all necessary multiplication table entries are covered.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The `n*i` calculation is perfectly sound, accurately computing each product.
    *   **Fundamental Logic is Sound:** The overall structure and logic for generating the multiplication table are correct.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Formatting:** The primary issue leading to the "Wrong Answer" status is the output format, specifically regarding spacing and newlines.
        *   **Excess Newlines:** Your `print(n,"*", i, "=", n*i,"\n")` statement explicitly adds a newline character (`"\n"`) as its last argument. However, Python's `print()` function already adds a newline character by default *after* printing all its arguments. This means each line of your multiplication table is followed by *two* newline characters, which is not the expected output format for most competitive programming problems.
        *   **Default Spacing:** When you pass multiple arguments separated by commas to `print()`, Python automatically inserts a space between each argument. For example, `print(n, "*", i)` might output `5 * 1` instead of the more common `5*1`. While sometimes acceptable, often exact spacing like `5*1 = 5` is expected, without extra spaces around the `*` or `=`.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To fix the output formatting and achieve the exact expected output, you should control the spacing and ensure only a single newline per line of output.

*   **1. Use f-strings for precise formatting (Recommended):**
    F-strings (formatted string literals) provide a clean and powerful way to embed expressions inside string literals, giving you full control over the output.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # This will print e.g., "5*1 = 5" followed by a single newline
    ```
    This approach is generally preferred for its readability and conciseness when formatting output.

*   **2. Use `sep=''` with manual spacing in `print()`:**
    You can prevent `print()` from adding default spaces between arguments by setting `sep=''`, and then manually add spaces where you want them.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep='') # No extra newlines, controlled spacing
    ```
    Note the space around the equals sign (`" = "`) is added manually here.

By implementing one of these formatting changes, your program should produce the correct output and successfully pass the tests. The fundamental logic you've written is already very close to a correct solution!
