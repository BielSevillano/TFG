### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar"

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its complete multiplication table. The student's program approaches this by reading the input `n` and then using a `while` loop to iterate through multipliers `i`, calculating and printing `n * i` for each step.

**Code Analysis (Strengths and Weaknesses):**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input:** The program correctly reads the integer input `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
*   **Fundamental Logic:** It correctly identifies the need for a loop and performs the multiplication `n*i` accurately.
*   **Basic Output Attempt:** The program makes a valid attempt to print the result on each line in a structured format.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Loop Range (Primary Issue):** The most critical flaw is the loop condition `while i <= n:`. A standard multiplication table typically goes up to 10 (i.e., `n * 1` to `n * 10`). However, this program's loop terminates when `i` reaches `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 9, the table will always be incomplete (e.g., if `n` is 5, it will only print `n*1` to `n*5`). This is the direct cause of the "Wrong Answer" status.
*   **Output Formatting:** While an attempt is made, the specific `print` calls `print(n,"*", i ,sep="", end=" ")` followed by `print("=", (n*i))` results in an output format like `N*I =RESULT` (e.g., `3*1 =3`). Most problem setters expect specific spacing, often `N * I = RESULT` or `N*I = RESULT`, including a space after the equals sign. The lack of a space after `=` in the output could also contribute to a "Wrong Answer" if the judge is strict about exact string matching.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Loop Range:**
    The `while` loop condition needs to be changed to ensure the table runs from 1 to 10.
    *   **Option 1 (using `while` loop):** Change `while i <= n:` to `while i <= 10:`.
    *   **Option 2 (using `for` loop - recommended for clarity and conciseness):** Replace the `while` loop with a `for` loop:
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11): # range(start, stop) goes up to stop-1, so 11 for up to 10
            # ... print logic ...
        ```
2.  **Improve Output Formatting:**
    For cleaner and more robust output formatting, consider using f-strings or carefully adjusting the `print` arguments and `sep` values.
    *   **Using f-strings (recommended):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This format (`N * I = RESULT`) is generally clear and widely accepted. If `N*I = RESULT` is expected (no spaces around `*` or `=`), adjust accordingly: `print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")`. Given the typical expectations, having spaces around operators like `*` and `=` is often preferred for readability.

By addressing the loop range and output formatting, the program will correctly generate the full multiplication table as expected.
