### Feedback for 'Taula de multiplicar' Program

**1. Problem and Solution Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from `n*1` to `n*10`.

The provided solution effectively tackles this problem. It first uses `easyinput.read(int)` to get the input number `n`. Then, it employs a `for` loop iterating from 1 to 10 (using `range(1, 11)`). Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n*i` for each `i` and prints the multiplication expression and its result in the desired format (`n*i = result`).

**2. Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the logic and produces the expected output, as indicated by its "Accepted" status. It handles the full range of the multiplication table from 1 to 10.
*   **Readability:** The code is very clear and easy to understand. The variable names `n` and `i` are standard and intuitive for this problem.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is compact and to the point, solving the problem with minimal lines of code.
*   **Pythonic Approach:** The use of a `for` loop with `range()` for a fixed number of iterations is a standard and Pythonic way to solve this kind of problem.
*   **Efficiency:** For a task involving only 10 iterations, the code is highly efficient and performs optimally.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Output Formatting:** While functionally correct, the output formatting using `str(n)+'*'+str(i)` for string concatenation and relying on `print`'s default separator (a space) for `print(..., '=', ...)` is a slightly less modern or explicit approach compared to f-strings or `str.format()`. This doesn't affect correctness or performance significantly but can make the output line slightly more verbose to construct.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Utilize f-strings for Output Formatting:** For cleaner and more modern string formatting in Python, consider using f-strings (formatted string literals). This can make the `print` statement more concise and readable.

    **Current line:**
    ```python
    print(str(n)+'*'+str(i),'=', n*i)
    ```

    **Suggested improvement:**
    ```python
    print(f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}')
    ```
    This directly embeds the variables and expressions into the string, making the output construction more straightforward and explicit. Many of the alternative solutions demonstrate this approach (e.g., the solutions using `print(f'{n}*1 = {n*1}')` or `print(F"{n}*{1} = {n*1}")`).

**Overall:**
This is an excellent and robust solution to the "Taula de multiplicar" problem. It's clear, concise, correct, and follows good programming practices for simple tasks. The suggested improvement is purely a stylistic enhancement for more modern Python output formatting, not a fix for any functional flaw.
