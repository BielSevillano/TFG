**Feedback for Program: Taula de multiplicar**

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks to read an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program approaches this by first reading the input `n` using `yogi.read`. It then uses a `while` loop, initializing a counter `i` to 1, and continues as long as `i` is less than 11. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints it using an f-string, finally incrementing `i`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The code correctly reads the input number `n` and implements the core logic for generating the multiplication table. It iterates from 1 to 10, performing the correct multiplication in each step.
    *   **Clarity:** The variable names (`n`, `i`, `resultado`) are clear, and the code's intent is easy to understand.
    *   **Input Handling:** It correctly uses `from yogi import read` to handle input as specified by the problem environment.
    *   **F-strings:** The use of f-strings for output (`F"{n}*{i}={resultado}"`) is a modern and efficient way to format strings in Python.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Primary Issue):** The main reason for the "Wrong Answer" status is highly likely due to the output format. While the problem description does not explicitly state the exact format, competitive programming platforms like Jutge.org are very particular about matching the expected output exactly, including spaces.
        *   Your code outputs `N*M=RESULT` (e.g., `2*5=10`).
        *   Many successful solutions (and common convention) typically include spaces around the equals sign, such as `N*M = RESULT` (e.g., `2*5 = 10`) or even `N * M = RESULT`. The absence of these specific spaces is often enough to trigger a "Wrong Answer" verdict.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format:** This is the most crucial change to resolve the "Wrong Answer". Modify your print statement to include spaces around the equals sign.
    *   **Current:** `print(F"{n}*{i}={resultado}")`
    *   **Suggested Change:** `print(F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}")`
    This change ensures that there is a space before and after the equals sign, matching the common expected format seen in other correct solutions.

2.  **Consider Using a `for` loop (Pythonic Improvement):** While your `while` loop is functionally correct, a `for` loop with `range()` is generally considered more Pythonic and often more concise for iterating a fixed number of times.
    *   You could replace your `while` loop with:
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11): # This iterates from i=1 up to, but not including, i=11
            resultado = n * i
            print(F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}") # Remember the format correction here too
        ```
    This doesn't change the correctness of the program but makes the intention of iterating a sequence more explicit and idiomatic in Python.
