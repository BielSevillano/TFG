This program effectively solves the "Taula de multiplicar" problem.

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (guaranteed to be between 1 and 9) and then printing its complete multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program addresses this by first using `easyinput.read(int)` to get the input number `n`. It then employs a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive) to calculate and print each line of the multiplication table in the format `n*i = result`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program correctly generates the multiplication table for the given input `n`, as confirmed by the "Accepted" result. It adheres to the problem's requirements.
    *   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very concise and straightforward. The use of a standard `for` loop makes the logic easy to understand for anyone familiar with basic programming constructs.
    *   **Efficiency:** For a small, fixed range (1 to 10), a simple `for` loop is highly efficient and perfectly suitable.
    *   **Idiomatic Python:** The loop-based approach is the most Pythonic and scalable way to generate a sequence of operations like a multiplication table, unlike solutions that hardcode each print statement.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting:** While functional, the print statement `print(str(n)+'*'+str(i),'=', n*i)` mixes string concatenation with passing multiple arguments to `print`. When multiple arguments are passed with commas, `print` inserts a default space separator. This implicitly achieves the desired spacing but is less explicit and potentially less flexible than other formatting methods.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Use f-strings for cleaner output formatting:** Python's f-strings (formatted string literals) provide a more concise and readable way to construct output strings, especially when combining variables and literal text. This would also ensure consistent spacing.

    *   **Current line:**
        ```python
        print(str(n)+'*'+str(i),'=', n*i)
        ```
    *   **Suggested improvement:**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    This change would make the output formatting more explicit, remove the need for manual `str()` conversions, and generally improve the readability of the print statement. This approach is also seen in several of the reference solutions, highlighting its common adoption.

Overall, the program is a well-structured and correct solution to the problem. The suggested improvement focuses on a minor stylistic enhancement in output formatting, which doesn't detract from the code's functional correctness or efficiency.
