### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and display its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The student's program effectively addresses this by first reading the input number `n` using `yogi.read()`. It then employs a `while` loop that iterates from `i = 1` up to `i = 10`. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints the result on a new line for each iteration.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The program correctly implements the core logic for generating a multiplication table. It iterates through the correct range (1 to 10) and performs the multiplication accurately.
    *   **Readability:** The code is clear and easy to understand, with meaningful variable names (`n`, `i`, `resultado`). The use of an f-string for output formatting contributes to its readability.
    *   **Correct Iteration:** The `while i < 11` condition correctly ensures that the loop executes for `i` values from 1 to 10, inclusive.
    *   **Appropriate Input Handling:** Using `from yogi import read` is suitable for the contest environment.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Format Mismatch (Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is a subtle but critical difference in the output format. The problem often implies a very specific string format, especially concerning spaces.
        Your current code prints `F"{n}*{i}={resultado}"`, which produces output like `5*1=5`.
        However, based on common practices and successful solutions for this type of problem, the expected output likely includes a space before the equals sign, i.e., `5*1 = 5`. This seemingly small difference is often crucial in automated judging systems.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format:** To fix the "Wrong Answer," simply add a space before the equals sign in your print statement:
    ```python
    # Change this line:
    # print(F"{n}*{i}={resultado}")
    # To this:
    print(F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}")
    ```
    This change will align your output with the likely expected format.

2.  **Consider a `for` loop (Alternative Style):** While your `while` loop is perfectly functional, Python's `for` loop with `range()` is often considered more idiomatic for iterating over a known sequence of numbers. It can make the code slightly more concise by handling the initialization and increment of the loop variable implicitly.
    ```python
    # Alternative using a for loop:
    # from yogi import read
    #
    # n = read(int)
    #
    # for i in range(1, 11): # This iterates i from 1 up to (but not including) 11
    #     resultado = n * i
    #     print(F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}")
    ```
    This is a stylistic suggestion and not strictly necessary for correctness once the output format is fixed.

By implementing the suggested change to the output format, your program should pass the test cases successfully.
