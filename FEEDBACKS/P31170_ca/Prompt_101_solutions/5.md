This program effectively solves the problem of generating a multiplication table for a given integer `n`. The solution was accepted, indicating its correctness and adherence to the problem's requirements.

**Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output for each line should be in the format `n * i = n*i`.
The provided solution takes a direct approach: it reads the integer `n` using `yogi.read`, then employs a `for` loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the product `n*i` and prints the formatted string `n * i = n*i` using the `print` function with `sep=''` to control spacing.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program accurately calculates and prints the multiplication table for the given input, exactly matching the specified output format, which is why it achieved an "Accepted" status.
    *   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very straightforward and easy to understand. The use of standard variable names like `n` for the input number and `i` for the loop counter makes the logic immediately apparent.
    *   **Conciseness:** The solution is compact and efficient, using Python's built-in `for` loop and `range` function to iterate precisely the required number of times.
    *   **Effective Formatting:** The `sep=''` argument in the `print` function is well-utilized to ensure that there are no extra spaces between the elements being printed, resulting in the exact desired output format.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Redundant Variable Initialization:** The line `i=0` before the `for` loop is redundant. The variable `i` is immediately reassigned by the `for i in range(1, 11):` statement when the loop begins, making its initial value of `0` unused and unnecessary. This is a minor point, as it doesn't affect the program's correctness or performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Redundant Initialization:** You can safely delete the line `i=0`. The `for` loop handles the initialization and iteration of `i` perfectly on its own.
    ```python
    # Current code:
    # i=0
    # for i in range (1, 11):
    #     print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')

    # Improved code:
    # for i in range (1, 11):
    #     print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')
    ```
2.  **Consider using f-strings for Output (Optional, but often preferred):** While your current `print` statement with `sep=''` is perfectly functional, Python's f-strings often provide a more modern, concise, and readable way to format output that mixes literals and variables.
    ```python
    # Current print statement:
    # print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')

    # Alternative using an f-string:
    # print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This is a stylistic preference, but f-strings are widely adopted for their clarity in string formatting.
