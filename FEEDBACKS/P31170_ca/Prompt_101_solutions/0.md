Here's a feedback text for the program:

**Feedback for Taula de multiplicar**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input `n` using `yogi.read`. It then prints a descriptive header "taula de multiplicar n" and proceeds to use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers, calculating and printing `n` multiplied by each number.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer `n` using `yogi.read`.
    *   **Appropriate Loop Structure:** Using a `for` loop is an efficient and suitable way to iterate through the required multiplication factors.
    *   **Correct Multiplication Calculation:** The expression `n*i` correctly calculates the product for each line.
    *   **`sep=''` Usage:** The `sep=''` argument in the `print` function is correctly used to avoid extra spaces between the elements, which is often crucial for exact output matching in judge systems.

*   **Weaknesses (Reasons for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Incorrect Loop Range:** The `for i in range(11)` loop iterates `i` from `0` to `10` (inclusive). The problem explicitly asks for the multiplication table from `1` to `10`. Printing `n * 0` as the first line is incorrect and leads to a "Wrong Answer".
    *   **Unnecessary Output Header:** The line `print('taula de multiplicar', n)` prints an introductory message. In competitive programming platforms like Jutge.org, the output must typically match the exact specification, meaning only the multiplication table rows should be printed, without any additional headers or descriptive text. This extra line of output will cause a "Wrong Answer" due to incorrect format.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To correct the program and achieve an "Accepted" status, consider the following changes:

1.  **Adjust the Loop Range:** Change the `for` loop to iterate from `1` to `10`. In Python, this is achieved by modifying `range(11)` to `range(1, 11)`. This ensures that the table starts with `n * 1` and ends with `n * 10`.
    ```python
    # Change from:
    # for i in range (11):
    # To:
    for i in range (1, 11):
    ```
2.  **Remove the Header Print Statement:** Delete the line that prints the introductory message.
    ```python
    # Remove this line:
    # print('taula de multiplicar', n)
    ```

By implementing these two changes, your program will produce the exact output required by the problem statement.
