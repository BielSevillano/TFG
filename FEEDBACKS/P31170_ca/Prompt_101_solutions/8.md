This feedback addresses your Python program for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem, which received a "Wrong Answer" verdict.

### 1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary

The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. Each line of the output should display the multiplication in a specific format.

Your program approaches this by:
1.  Reading the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
2.  Using a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10.
3.  Inside the loop, calculating the product `n * i` for each `i`.
4.  Printing the multiplication expression and its result using `print()`, specifying `sep=''` to control the spacing between elements.

### 2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer input using `easyinput.read(int)`.
*   **Correct Loop Range:** The `for i in range(1, 11)` loop correctly iterates from 1 up to and including 10, which is necessary for a complete multiplication table.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `a * i` is performed accurately.

**Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**

*   **Output Formatting:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is a subtle but crucial error in the output format, specifically regarding the spacing around the equality sign `=`.
    *   Your code uses: `print(str(a), "*", str(i), "=", ' ', str(a*i), sep = '')`
    *   When `sep=''` is used, this concatenates the arguments directly. For `a=5, i=1`, this would produce `5*1= 5`.
    *   The expected format, based on typical problem requirements and numerous correct reference solutions, typically includes a space *before* and *after* the equals sign. For example: `5*1 = 5`.
    *   Your code produces `= ` (the equals sign followed by a single space), while the expected output is ` = ` (a space, then equals, then a space). This mismatch causes the "Wrong Answer".

*   **Redundant String Conversions:** While not an error, explicitly converting `a` and `i` to `str()` inside the `print()` function when `sep=''` is used is somewhat redundant. Python's `print()` function can handle mixed types when `sep` is specified, or you can leverage f-strings for cleaner formatting.

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

To correct the "Wrong Answer" and improve the code:

1.  **Correct the Output Formatting:** Adjust the `print` statement to include a space before and after the equals sign.

    *   **Option 1 (Minimal Change):** Change `'='` and `' '` to `" = "` as a single string argument.
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        a = read(int)
        for i in range(1, 11):
            # Change from: "=", ' ', ...
            # To:         " = ", ...
            print(str(a), "*", str(i), " = ", str(a*i), sep='')
        ```
    *   **Option 2 (More Idiomatic Python with f-strings):** This is often the cleanest way to format strings with variables.
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        a = read(int)
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}")
        ```
        This approach automatically handles the conversion to string and the correct spacing.

2.  **Improve Variable Naming (Optional but Recommended):** Using `n` instead of `a` for the input number would align better with the problem description and make the code slightly more readable.

By implementing the formatting correction, your program should pass the test cases.
