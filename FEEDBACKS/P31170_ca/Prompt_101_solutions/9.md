This feedback addresses your Python program for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem, which resulted in a "Presentation Error".

### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. Your program correctly implements this by reading the input `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10, calculating `n * i` in each iteration, and attempts to print the result in the format `n * i = n*i`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core logic of reading the input, looping from 1 to 10, and performing the multiplication is perfectly sound and correctly implemented.
    *   **Appropriate Data Types:** You correctly read `n` as an integer.
    *   **`sep=''` Usage:** You've correctly identified that controlling the default space separator in the `print` function (`sep=''`) is often necessary for precise output formatting, which is a good practice for competitive programming.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Presentation Error Cause):** The primary issue leading to the "Presentation Error" lies in your `print` statement:
        ```python
        print(n,"*",i," = ",n*i,"\n", sep='')
        ```
        The `print` function in Python, by default, adds a newline character (`\n`) at the end of each call (`end='\n'`). By explicitly including `"\n"` as one of the arguments you're printing, you are essentially printing *two* newline characters after each line of the multiplication table (one explicitly added, and one added by default by `print`). This results in an extra blank line between each entry in the multiplication table, which does not match the expected output format.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To resolve the "Presentation Error", you simply need to remove the redundant newline character from your `print` statement. The `print` function will automatically add one newline at the end of each line, which is usually the desired behavior for this type of problem.

**Revised `print` statement:**
```python
print(n,"*",i," = ",n*i, sep='')
```

This change will ensure that each line of the multiplication table is followed by exactly one newline, matching the typical requirements for this problem.

**Example of corrected code:**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
for i in range(1,11):
    print(n,"*",i," = ",n*i, sep='') # Removed the explicit "\n"
```

With this minor adjustment, your program should now produce the correct output format and pass the "Presentation Error".
