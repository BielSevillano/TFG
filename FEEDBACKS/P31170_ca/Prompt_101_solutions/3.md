### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output should display each multiplication step in a specific format.

**Solution Approach:**
The program implements a straightforward and logically sound approach. It reads the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. Then, it uses a `for` loop iterating from 1 to 10 (inclusive) to calculate and print each line of the multiplication table.

**Code's Strengths:**
*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The code is very easy to read and understand, demonstrating a clear grasp of basic input/output and loop structures.
*   **Correct Logic:** The core logic of reading `n`, iterating from 1 to 10, and calculating `n * i` is perfectly correct.
*   **Appropriate Loop Range:** `range(1, 11)` correctly includes the numbers from 1 up to and including 10.

**Code's Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
The primary weakness, and the likely cause of the "Wrong Answer" verdict, lies in the **output formatting**.
1.  **Default `print` Separators:** By default, Python's `print()` function inserts a single space between each argument it receives. So, `print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i)` will produce output like `2 * 1 = 2` (with extra spaces around the `*` and `=` signs). Competitive programming platforms often require exact string matching, meaning these extra spaces can lead to a "Wrong Answer".
2.  **Redundant Newline Character:** The `print()` function automatically adds a newline character (`\n`) at the end of its output. By explicitly adding `"\n"` as the last argument in your `print` call (`print(..., "\n")`), you are essentially printing *two* newline characters after each line of the multiplication table. This results in an extra blank line between each entry, which deviates from the expected output format.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
To achieve the exact output formatting required by most competitive programming judges, you can modify the `print` statement:

1.  **Use `sep=""`:** The most common fix is to tell the `print` function to use an empty string as a separator between arguments. This removes the unwanted spaces. Also, remove the redundant `"\n"`.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="") # Added sep="" and removed explicit "\n"
    ```
    This will produce output like: `2*1 = 2`

2.  **Use f-strings (Formatted String Literals):** For more precise control over string formatting, f-strings are an excellent modern Python feature.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Using an f-string for exact formatting
    ```
    This also produces output like: `2*1 = 2`

Many of the other successful solutions provided use either `sep=""` or f-strings to manage output formatting precisely, which is the key difference between your current code and a correct solution.
