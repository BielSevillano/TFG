**Feedback for Taula de multiplicar**

**1. Summary of Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires the program to read a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its complete multiplication table. The provided solution reads the integer `n` using `yogi.read`. It then uses a `while` loop, initializing a counter `a` to 1. The loop iteratively calculates `n * a` and prints the result in the format "n*a = n*a" for values of `a` from 1 up to 9.

**2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Handling:** The program successfully reads the integer input `n` using `yogi.read(int)`.
*   **Appropriate Loop Structure:** The use of a `while` loop is a valid approach for iterating and generating the table entries. The loop counter `a` is correctly initialized and incremented.
*   **Accurate Calculations:** The multiplication `n*a` is performed correctly for each iteration.
*   **Clear Output Format:** Each line of the multiplication table is printed with the correct format, effectively concatenating the strings for `n`, `a`, and their product.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incomplete Output (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):** The core issue leading to the "Wrong Answer" is the condition of the `while` loop: `a <= 9`. This causes the program to print the multiplication table only up to `n * 9`. Standard multiplication tables, and generally what's expected for this problem, include the entry for `n * 10`. The program stops one step short of the complete table.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To correct the "Wrong Answer" and ensure the program produces the full multiplication table as expected:

1.  **Adjust the Loop Condition:** Modify the `while` loop condition to include the tenth multiplication.
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    a = 1           

    while (a <= 10): # Change condition from a <= 9 to a <= 10
        print(str(n)+"*"+str(a)+" = "+str((n*a)))
        a = a+1
    ```
2.  **Consider using a `for` loop:** For iterating over a predefined range, a `for` loop with `range()` is often more Pythonic and can make the code more concise and less prone to off-by-one errors.
    ```python
    from yogi import read # Or from easyinput import read, if that's the preferred library

    n = read(int)

    for a in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11, i.e., 1 to 10.
        print(str(n)+"*"+str(a)+" = "+str((n*a)))
    ```

These changes will ensure the program correctly generates the complete multiplication table from `n*1` to `n*10`.
