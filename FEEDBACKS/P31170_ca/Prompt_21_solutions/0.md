### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The provided solution approaches this by:
*   Reading the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
*   Initializing a counter `i` to 1.
*   Using a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is not equal to 11 (meaning it iterates from `i=1` to `i=10`).
*   Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication expression (`n * i`) and its result (`n * i`) using `print` with `sep=''`, which prevents extra spaces between the elements.
*   Incrementing `i` in each iteration.

**2. Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The code accurately solves the problem and produces the expected output. The loop condition `while 11 != i:` correctly ensures that the multiplication table is printed for `i` from 1 to 10.
    *   **Clarity:** The logic is straightforward and easy to understand, making it simple to follow the program's flow.
    *   **Conciseness:** The solution is compact and directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print` statement is effective for controlling the spacing between elements, ensuring the output matches the typical format expected in such problems.
    *   **Efficiency:** For the given constraints, the solution is highly efficient, performing a fixed number of operations.

*   **Weaknesses (or areas for minor refinement):**
    *   **Loop Idiom:** While functionally correct, `while 11 != i:` is slightly less common than `while i <= 10:` or, even more typically, using a `for` loop with `range()`.
    *   **Modularity:** The code resides entirely in the global scope. For larger or more complex problems, encapsulating the logic within functions (e.g., a `main` function or a dedicated `print_table` function) improves code organization, reusability, and readability.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Prefer `for` loop with `range()`:** Python's `for` loop with `range()` is generally more idiomatic and concise for iterating a fixed number of times. The code could be refactored as:
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11): # Iterates from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n * i, sep='')
    ```
    This style is very common in the reference solutions provided.

2.  **Encapsulate in a Function:** For better structure, consider wrapping the logic in a function:
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    def print_multiplication_table(num):
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(num, "*", i, " = ", num * i, sep='')

    def main():
        n = read(int)
        print_multiplication_table(n)

    main()
    ```
    This improves modularity and makes the code more reusable.

3.  **Use f-strings for Output (Optional but often preferred):** F-strings offer a highly readable and flexible way to format output:
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This achieves the same output with potentially clearer string formatting, as seen in some of the reference solutions.
