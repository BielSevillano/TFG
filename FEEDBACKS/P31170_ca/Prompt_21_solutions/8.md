### Feedback on "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its full multiplication table, typically from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`.

**Solution Approach:**
Your program takes an integer input `n` using `yogi.read()`. It then initializes a counter `a` to `1`. A `while` loop is used to iterate, calculating and printing the product of `n` and `a` for each iteration, incrementing `a` in each step.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input:** The program correctly reads the integer input `n` using `yogi.read(int)`.
*   **Loop Structure:** It employs a `while` loop, which is a valid and functional way to iterate through the multiplication factors.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `n*a` is computed correctly.
*   **Output Formatting:** The output string `str(n)+"*"+str(a)+" = "+str((n*a))` generates a readable line for each multiplication, following a logical pattern.

**Weaknesses & Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
*   **Incomplete Multiplication Table:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" status is that your `while` loop condition is `while (a<=9):`. This means the loop will only execute for `a` values from 1 up to 9. A standard multiplication table typically includes the factor 10. Therefore, the output is missing the line for `n * 10`.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Extend the Loop Range (Critical Fix):**
    To solve the "Wrong Answer", you need to ensure the loop runs up to and including the factor 10. Change the `while` loop condition from `while (a<=9):` to `while (a<=10):`.

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)
    a = 1           

    while (a<=10): # Changed from a<=9 to a<=10
        print(str(n)+"*"+str(a)+" = "+str((n*a)))
        a = a+1
    ```

2.  **Improve Print Formatting (Optional, but Recommended for Readability):**
    While your current string concatenation works, using f-strings or the `sep` argument in `print()` can make your code cleaner and more Pythonic.

    *   **Using f-strings:**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{a} = {n*a}")
        ```
    *   **Using `print()` with `sep=""`:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", a, " = ", n*a, sep="")
        ```
    These options often result in more concise and readable output code.

3.  **Consider a `for` loop (Optional, more Pythonic for fixed iterations):**
    For iterating a fixed number of times (like 1 to 10), a `for` loop with `range()` is often preferred in Python.

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)

    for a in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) includes 1 up to (but not including) 11
        print(f"{n}*{a} = {n*a}")
    ```

By making the small change to the loop condition (Suggestion 1), your program will correctly produce the full multiplication table and should pass the test cases.
