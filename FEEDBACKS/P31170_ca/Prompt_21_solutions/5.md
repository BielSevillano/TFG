## Feedback for Program: Taula de multiplicar

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Taula de multiplicar" asks the user to write a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program addresses this by first reading the input number `n` into a variable `a`. It then employs a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive), calculating the product `a * i` in each iteration, and printing the result in a formatted string.

**Code Strengths:**

*   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer input using `from easyinput import read`, which is suitable for the contest environment.
*   **Logical Iteration:** It uses a `for` loop (`for i in range (1,11):`) that accurately iterates from 1 to 10, covering all required multiplications.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The core multiplication `a * i` is performed correctly for each step.
*   **Use of `sep=''`:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print` function is a good practice for controlling output spacing precisely, preventing Python's default space insertion between arguments.

**Code Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**

The program's "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly due to a **mismatch in output formatting**, specifically the spacing around the equals sign.
Let's analyze the `print` statement:
`print(str(a), "*", str(i), "=", ' ', str(a*i), sep = '')`

If the input `a` is 3 and `i` is 1, the output would be: `3*1= 3`
Notice that there is no space *before* the equals sign. Based on common expectations for this type of problem and how other successful solutions format their output, the standard format usually includes a space both before and after the equals sign, like this: `3*1 = 3`.

This subtle difference in spacing (`=` vs ` = `) is typically enough for an automated judge system to mark the answer as incorrect, even if the calculations are all correct.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

To correct the output format and achieve the expected result, you should adjust the `print` statement to include a space before the equals sign. Here are a couple of ways to do it:

1.  **Adjusting the `print` arguments with `sep=''`:**

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    a = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(str(a), "*", str(i), " = ", str(a*i), sep='')
    ```
    *(Here, `" = "` is treated as a single string literal, ensuring the space before and after the equals sign.)*

2.  **Using an f-string (formatted string literal):** This is often a cleaner and more readable way to handle complex string formatting.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    a = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'{a}*{i} = {a*i}')
    ```
    *(This f-string directly embeds the variables and correctly places the spaces around the equals sign.)*

Both of these suggestions will produce the output `N*I = RESULT`, which aligns with the typical expected format for multiplication tables and should resolve the "Wrong Answer".
