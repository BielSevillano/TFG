### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9, inclusive) and printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The submitted program attempts to solve this by reading the input `n`, then checking if `n` is within a specific range using an `if` statement. If it is, it iterates from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop, calculates the product `n*i`, and prints the result in the format `n*i = product`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Clear Intent:** The code's purpose is immediately understandable.
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The use of a `for` loop iterating from 1 to 10 and the calculation `n*i` correctly implement the core multiplication table generation.
    *   **Standard Input:** Correctly uses `easyinput.read(int)` for reading integer input.

*   **Weaknesses (Reasons for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Incorrect Input Range Check:** The primary issue is the `if 1 < n < 10:` condition. The problem states that `n` is "entre 1 i 9" (between 1 and 9), which usually implies `1 <= n <= 9`. The current condition `1 < n < 10` **excludes** the values `n=1` and `n=9`. If the input `n` is 1 or 9, the `if` block will not execute, and the program will print nothing, leading to a "Wrong Answer" because the multiplication table for these valid inputs will be missing.
    *   **Output Formatting Discrepancy:** The `print` statement `print(str(n) + "*" + str(i), "=", s)` uses default spacing when multiple arguments are provided to `print()`. This results in an extra space between the concatenated string (`str(n) + "*" + str(i)`) and the `"="` symbol (e.g., `2*1  = 2`), which is likely not the exact output format expected by the judging system. Most other solutions use `sep=''` or f-strings to ensure precise spacing (e.g., `2*1 = 2`).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Input Range:**
    *   Change the `if` condition to `if 1 <= n <= 9:` to correctly include `n=1` and `n=9`.
    *   **Recommendation:** For contest problems where the input constraints guarantee valid input (like "natural n entre 1 i 9"), it's often safer and simpler to **remove the `if` statement entirely**. The problem description implies `n` will always be within the valid range, so no explicit check is strictly necessary for correctness, preventing accidental exclusion of valid inputs.

2.  **Improve Output Formatting:**
    *   **Option 1 (using `sep`):** Modify the `print` statement to explicitly control separators:
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", s, sep="")
        ```
    *   **Option 2 (using f-strings - Recommended):** Use an f-string for cleaner and more precise output formatting:
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {s}")
        ```
    This will ensure the output matches the expected format (e.g., `2*1 = 2` without extraneous spaces).
