**Feedback for 'Taula de multiplicar' Program**

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table. The provided program reads the input number `n` using `yogi.read()`. It then initializes a counter `a` to 1 and uses a `while` loop to iterate, printing each line of the multiplication table in the format `n*a = n*a` until a certain condition is met.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Clarity:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, directly reflecting the logical steps to generate a multiplication table.
*   **Correct Input Handling:** It correctly reads an integer input using `yogi.read(int)`.
*   **Basic Logic:** The core multiplication logic `n*a` and the increment of the counter `a = a + 1` are correctly implemented.
*   **Output Format:** The string concatenation `str(n)+"*"+str(a)+" = "+str((n*a))` produces an output format that generally matches the expected appearance for a multiplication table line (e.g., `2*1 = 2`).

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incomplete Output (Primary Reason for "Wrong Answer"):** The most critical issue, and the likely cause for the "Wrong Answer" status, is the loop condition `while (a<=9):`. A standard multiplication table typically goes up to `n * 10`. This program stops at `n * 9`, thus omitting the last required line (e.g., `2*10 = 20`) from the output.
*   **Readability/Conciseness of Output Formatting:** While functional, using multiple `str()` conversions and string concatenations can be less readable and slightly more verbose than modern Python formatting options.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Correct the Loop Condition:** To ensure the full multiplication table up to 10 is printed, you need to adjust the `while` loop condition. Change `while (a<=9):` to `while (a<=10):`.
    *   **Example Correction:**
        ```python
        from yogi import read

        n = read(int)
        a = 1           

        while (a <= 10): # Changed from a <= 9
            print(str(n)+"*"+str(a)+" = "+str((n*a)))
            a = a+1
        ```
*   **Improve Output Formatting (Optional but Recommended):** For more concise and readable code, consider using f-strings (formatted string literals), which are a more modern and Pythonic way to format strings.
    *   **Example using f-strings:**
        ```python
        # ... inside the loop
        print(f"{n}*{a} = {n*a}")
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can use the `print()` function's `sep` argument for precise spacing control, similar to some reference solutions:
        ```python
        # ... inside the loop
        print(n, "*", a, " = ", n*a, sep="")
        ```
*   **Consider a `for` Loop:** For iterating a fixed number of times (like 1 to 10), a `for` loop with `range()` is often considered more idiomatic and less prone to off-by-one errors (like the one encountered) than a `while` loop that requires manual counter management.
    *   **Example using a `for` loop:**
        ```python
        from yogi import read

        n = read(int)

        for a in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11, i.e., 1 to 10.
            print(f"{n}*{a} = {n*a}")
        ```

By implementing the suggested correction to the loop condition, your program should pass the "Wrong Answer" status and correctly generate the complete multiplication table.
