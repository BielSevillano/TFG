### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.

Your program approaches this by:
*   Reading the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
*   Initializing a counter `i` to 1.
*   Using a `while` loop to iterate from `i = 1` up to `i = 10`.
*   Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication expression `n * i = result` for each `i`.
*   Incrementing `i` in each iteration.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Logic:** The core multiplication logic (`a * i`) is correct, and the loop correctly iterates from 1 to 10, generating all required entries for the multiplication table.
*   **Appropriate Loop Usage:** Using a `while` loop for a fixed number of iterations is a valid approach, though a `for` loop might be more idiomatic in Python for this specific scenario.
*   **Correct Input Reading:** It correctly uses `easyinput.read(int)` to get the integer input.

**Weaknesses (Likely cause of "Wrong Answer"):**
*   **Output Formatting:** The most probable reason for the "Wrong Answer" is the exact spacing in the output. When you use `print (a, "*", i, "=", a*i)`, Python's `print` function automatically inserts a space character between each item passed with a comma.
    *   For `n=2, i=1`, your code would print: `2 * 1 = 2` (with spaces around the `*` and `=`).
    *   Competitive programming platforms usually expect an exact match to a specific output format. Based on common practice and several reference solutions, the expected format is likely `N*I = R` or `N*I=R`, where `N`, `I`, `R` are the numbers, and the `*` and `=` symbols might not have spaces directly adjacent to them, or have specific spacing around them.
    *   For example, many reference solutions show `2*1 = 2` (no space between `2` and `*`, and `*` and `1`, but one space before `=` and one after it). Your current output has extra spaces.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output Formatting (Crucial Fix):** To match the likely expected output format, you should explicitly control the spacing using `sep=''` in the `print` function or use an f-string.

    *   **Using `sep=''`:**
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        a = read(int)
        i = 1

        while i <= 10:
            # This format is common and likely expected: 'N*I = R'
            print(a, "*", i, " = ", a*i, sep="") # Removes all default spaces
            i = i + 1
        ```
        This would produce `2*1 = 2`, `2*2 = 4`, etc.

    *   **Using f-strings (Recommended for modern Python):**
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        a = read(int)
        i = 1

        while i <= 10:
            print(f'{a}*{i} = {a*i}')
            i = i + 1
        ```
        This also produces `2*1 = 2`, `2*2 = 4`, etc., and is generally more readable and flexible for complex string formatting.

2.  **Use a `for` loop for fixed iterations (Idiomatic Python):** While your `while` loop is correct, a `for` loop with `range` is often preferred for a known number of iterations.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)

    # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11.
    # So, it gives 1, 2, ..., 10.
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'{n}*{i} = {n*i}')
    ```

3.  **Encapsulation in a Function (Good Practice):** For slightly larger programs, it's good practice to put the core logic into a function (as seen in many reference solutions).

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    def print_multiplication_table(num):
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f'{num}*{i} = {num*i}')

    def main():
        n = read(int)
        print_multiplication_table(n)

    main()
    ```

By addressing the output formatting, your program should pass the "Wrong Answer" test cases. The other suggestions are for improving readability and following common Python practices.
