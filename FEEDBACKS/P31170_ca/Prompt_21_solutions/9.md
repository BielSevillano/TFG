**Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The submitted program addresses this by first reading the integer `n` using the `easyinput` library. It then employs a `while` loop that iterates from `i = 1` up to `i = 10`. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints each line of the multiplication table in the specified format (e.g., `n*i = result`).

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the requested functionality and produces the accurate multiplication table for the given input `n`. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
    *   **Readability:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand. The variable names `n` and `i` are standard and intuitive for this problem.
    *   **Adherence to Requirements:** It correctly uses the `easyinput` library for input, which is often a specific requirement in competitive programming environments like Jutge.org.
    *   **Output Control:** The use of `sep=""` and `end=''` in the `print` statements demonstrates an awareness of how to fine-tune output formatting, even though it's split across two `print` calls.

*   **Weaknesses (Areas for minor improvement in style/idiomatic Python):**
    *   **Loop Choice:** While the `while` loop is functionally correct, Python's `for` loop with `range()` is generally considered more idiomatic and concise for iterating a fixed number of times. It reduces the chance of off-by-one errors and removes the need for manual loop variable initialization and increment.
    *   **Multiple Print Statements for One Line:** Using two `print` statements (`print(n, "*", i, sep="", end='')` and `print(" =", n*i)`) to construct a single line of output is less efficient and less Pythonic than using a single `print` statement, especially with f-strings.
    *   **Redundant Semicolon:** The semicolon at `i = 1;` is not standard Python style and is generally omitted. While Python parsers often ignore it, it's best practice to avoid it.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Adopt a `for` loop with `range()`:** This would make the code more concise and align with common Python practices.
    ```python
    # Current:
    # i = 1
    # while(i < 11):
    #     # ...
    #     i = i+1

    # Suggested:
    for i in range(1, 11): # Iterates i from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
        # ...
    ```

*   **Combine print statements using f-strings (recommended) or a single `print` with `sep`:** This improves efficiency and readability.
    *   **Using an f-string (most Pythonic):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using a single `print` with `sep=""`:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```

*   **Remove the redundant semicolon:**
    ```python
    # Current:
    # i = 1;

    # Suggested:
    i = 1
    ```

**Revised Example (incorporating suggestions):**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
```

This revised version is more concise, idiomatic, and maintains the correct functionality while improving code style.
