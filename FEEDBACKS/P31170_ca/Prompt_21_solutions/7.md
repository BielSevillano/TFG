### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its complete multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The provided solution approaches this by first reading the integer `n` using `easyinput.read()`. It then employs a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 (using `range(1, 11)`). Inside the loop, it prints each line of the multiplication table in the format "n * i = product", utilizing the `sep=""` argument in the `print` function to avoid default spaces between the printed items.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly solves the problem as described, producing the exact multiplication table for the given input `n`. The output format also aligns with standard expectations for a multiplication table.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is exceptionally clear and easy to understand. The variable names `n` and `i` are standard and intuitive for this context.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is very compact, achieving the desired result in just a few lines of code.
*   **Efficiency:** For a problem of this scale (10 iterations), the solution is highly efficient, performing a minimal number of operations.
*   **Pythonic Use of `print`:** The use of `sep=""` in the `print` statement is an effective and Pythonic way to control spacing and achieve the desired output format without manual string concatenation.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Modularity (Minor):** For such a small program, it's not a critical flaw, but the code could benefit from being encapsulated within a function (e.g., a `main` function or a dedicated `print_multiplication_table` function). This improves organization and reusability, especially as programs grow in complexity. Many of the alternative solutions demonstrate this pattern.
*   **No Comments/Docstrings:** While the code is very self-explanatory, adding a brief comment at the top or a docstring if it were a function would be good practice for documenting its purpose.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Introduce a Function for Modularity:** Consider wrapping the logic within a function. This makes the code more organized and easier to test or integrate into larger programs.
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    def print_multiplication_table(num):
        """Prints the multiplication table for a given number."""
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(num, "*", i, " = ", num * i, sep="")

    # Main part of the program
    n = read(int)
    print_multiplication_table(n)
    ```
*   **Use f-strings for Output Formatting:** Python's f-strings (formatted string literals) offer a modern and often more readable way to format output. This can make the `print` statement even cleaner.
    ```python
    # Inside the loop:
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This achieves the same output as `sep=""` but can be preferred by many for its directness.
*   **Add Comments or Docstrings:** For better maintainability and understanding, especially for future readers (or yourself!), consider adding a brief comment explaining the program's purpose or a docstring if you create a function.
