Your program addresses the "Taula de multiplicar" problem, which requires generating the multiplication table for a given input number `n` (between 1 and 9).

**Summary of Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a program that reads an integer `n` and then outputs its multiplication table from `n*1` to `n*10`. Your program correctly reads an integer `n` using `easyinput` and then attempts to use a `for` loop to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10, printing a multiplication expression for each.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Reading:** The line `n=read(int)` correctly reads the integer input using the `easyinput` library, as required by the environment.
*   **Appropriate Loop Structure:** The `for i in range (1, 11):` loop is well-chosen for this problem, as it iterates precisely 10 times, covering the multipliers from 1 to 10.
*   **Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=""` in the `print` statement is a good practice for controlling spacing and achieving the desired output format without extra spaces between elements.

**Weaknesses and Reason for 'Wrong Answer':**
*   **Critical Error: Ignoring Input `n`:** The most significant flaw in your code is that it hardcodes the number `2` into the `print` statement and the calculation. Specifically, `print ("2*",i," = ",i*2, sep="")` always prints the multiplication table for `2`, regardless of the `n` value that was read from the input. The variable `n` is read but never actually used in the loop's output or calculation. This is why the program produces a "Wrong Answer" for any input `n` other than `2`.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Use the Input Variable `n`:** The core fix is to replace the hardcoded `2` with the `n` variable you read from the input.
    *   Change the `print` statement from:
        ```python
        print ("2*",i," = ",i*2, sep="")
        ```
    *   To:
        ```python
        print (n,"*",i," = ",n*i, sep="")
        ```
    This modification will ensure that the program calculates and prints the multiplication table for the actual number `n` provided by the user.

By making this change, your program will correctly use the input `n` to generate the multiplication table, aligning with the problem's requirements.
