### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.

The submitted program effectively solves this problem by first reading the input integer `n` using `yogi.read(int)`. It then uses a `while` loop to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product (`resultado`) of `n` and the current multiplier `i`, and prints the result in the specified `n*i = resultado` format using an f-string.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and displays the multiplication table for the given input `n`, adhering to the problem's requirements.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The variable names (`n`, `i`, `resultado`) are descriptive and easy to understand. The logic is straightforward and easy to follow.
*   **Modern Output Formatting:** The use of f-strings (`F"{n}*{i} = {resultado}"`) for printing the output is a modern, concise, and highly readable way to format strings in Python.
*   **Appropriate Loop Control:** The `while i < 11:` condition correctly ensures that the loop runs for `i` values from 1 to 10, including the `n * 10` entry.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Pythonic Iteration:** While functionally correct, using a `while` loop for iterating a fixed, known range (1 to 10) is generally less idiomatic in Python compared to a `for` loop with `range()`. Python's `for` loop is designed for such iterations and often leads to more concise and readable code for these scenarios.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Prefer `for` loops for fixed-range iterations:** For iterating a sequence of numbers like `1` to `10`, a `for` loop using `range()` is generally considered more "Pythonic" and often leads to cleaner code. The current `while` loop can be refactored as follows:

    ```python
    #taula  de multiplicar
    from yogi import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11): # Loop from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        resultado = n * i
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {resultado}")
    ```
    This removes the need for manual initialization of `i` before the loop and explicit increment (`i += 1`) inside the loop, making the code more concise.

2.  **Consider wrapping in a function (for larger programs):** For this simple script, it's not strictly necessary, but for larger or more complex programs, encapsulating the logic within a function (e.g., `def print_multiplication_table(num):`) can improve modularity and reusability.
