### Feedback on "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to read an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input `n`, then using a `for` loop to iterate through numbers, multiplying `n` by each number in the loop, and printing the result in the format `n * i = n*i`.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program successfully reads the integer `n` using `yogi.read(int)`.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `n * i` is performed accurately within the loop.
    *   **Loop Structure:** Using a `for` loop is an appropriate method for iterating a fixed number of times to generate the table.
    *   **Line Separation:** Each multiplication fact is printed on a new line, which is typically desired for a table output.

*   **Weaknesses (Reasons for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Extraneous Output:** The line `print('taula de multiplicar', n)` prints an introductory header. Problem statements on platforms like Jutge.org usually require *exact* output matching, meaning no additional text should be printed unless explicitly specified. This is the most likely primary reason for the "Wrong Answer".
    *   **Incorrect Loop Range:** The `for i in range(11)` generates numbers from `0` to `10`. Standard multiplication tables typically start from `1`. This means the program prints `n * 0 = 0`, which is usually not part of the expected output for a multiplication table. The table should go from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.
    *   **Default Print Spacing:** While not the primary cause of "Wrong Answer" for this problem, Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments, separates them with a space by default (e.g., `3 * 1 = 3`). Depending on the exact output format expected by the judge, this might introduce spacing discrepancies. Many reference solutions use `sep=''` or f-strings for more precise control.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the Header Line:** Delete the line `print('taula de multiplicar', n)`. The problem only asks for the table itself, not an introduction.
2.  **Correct the Loop Range:** Change the `for` loop to `for i in range(1, 11):`. This will make the loop iterate from `1` up to (and including) `10`, matching the standard definition of a multiplication table.
3.  **Consider Precise Output Formatting:** To ensure the output matches the exact requirements (especially regarding spacing), you could use an f-string or `sep=''` in the `print` statement:
    *   **Using f-string (recommended):** `print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")`
    *   **Using `sep=''`:** `print(n, '*', i, '=', n*i, sep='')` (Note: This would print `3*1=3` without spaces around the `*` and `=`. If spaces are needed, you would explicitly add them as strings: `print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')`). Based on common expectations, `f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}"` usually works well for problems like this.

By implementing these suggestions, the program will produce the exact expected output for the multiplication table.
