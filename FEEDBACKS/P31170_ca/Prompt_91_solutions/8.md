This feedback addresses your program for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem, which received a "Wrong Answer" verdict.

### 1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

The problem asks for a program that reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

Your solution correctly approaches this by:
1.  Reading the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
2.  Using a `for` loop to iterate through the multipliers `i` from 1 to 10 (inclusive, achieved with `range(1, 11)`).
3.  Inside the loop, calculating the product `n * i`.
4.  Printing the multiplication expression and its result.

### 2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Logic:** The fundamental logic for generating the multiplication table (reading `n`, looping from 1 to 10, and calculating `n*i`) is perfectly sound.
*   **Clear and Concise:** The code is straightforward, easy to read, and directly implements the problem's requirements.
*   **Appropriate Loop:** The `for i in range(1, 11)` construct is ideal for this fixed-range iteration.

**Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
The "Wrong Answer" verdict almost certainly stems from **incorrect output formatting**, specifically concerning spacing and extra newlines.
1.  **Default `sep` argument:** Python's `print()` function, by default, places a single space (`' '`) between each argument it prints. Your line `print(n,"*", i, "=", n*i,"\n")` therefore generates output like:
    `5 * 1 = 5 \n` (where `\n` represents a newline). This includes unwanted spaces around the `*` and `=` symbols if the expected output is `5*1 = 5`.
2.  **Redundant newline character:** You explicitly add `"\n"` as the last argument to your `print` statement. However, `print()` automatically appends a newline character at the end of its output by default (controlled by the `end='\n'` argument). This means your code outputs *two* newline characters after each line of the multiplication table, resulting in an empty line between each entry. This typically leads to a "Wrong Answer" in competitive programming environments, as exact output matching is required.

**Example of your output for n=5:**
```
5 * 1 = 5 

5 * 2 = 10 

...
```
(Note the empty line between entries)

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

To fix the output formatting and likely achieve an "Accepted" verdict, you should modify the `print` statement. Here are a couple of common and effective ways:

1.  **Using `sep=""` to control spacing:**
    By setting `sep=""`, you tell `print` not to put spaces between arguments by default. You then explicitly add spaces where you want them. You should also remove the redundant `"\n"`.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="") # Explicitly added spaces for " = "
    ```
    This would produce output like:
    `5*1 = 5`
    `5*2 = 10`
    ...

2.  **Using an f-string (Recommended for precise formatting):**
    F-strings (formatted string literals) provide a very clean and powerful way to construct output strings with exact control over spacing.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Direct formatting with no extra spaces or newlines
    ```
    This would produce the most common and likely expected output format:
    `5*1 = 5`
    `5*2 = 10`
    ...

Implementing either of these changes would resolve the output formatting issues and should lead to a correct submission for the problem.
