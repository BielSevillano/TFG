### Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program

**Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its multiplication table. The provided solution attempts to solve this by reading the input `n` and then using a `for` loop to iterate through numbers, printing each line of the multiplication table.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Reading:** The code correctly reads the integer input `n` using `from easyinput import read` and `n = read(int)`.
*   **Appropriate Control Flow:** Using a `for` loop is an excellent and efficient approach for iterating a fixed number of times to generate the multiplication table.
*   **Correct Multiplication Logic:** The calculation `n*i` correctly performs the multiplication for each line.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Loop Range:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is the range used in the `for` loop: `for i in range(10):`.
    *   `range(10)` generates numbers from `0` to `9` (inclusive). A standard multiplication table, as implied by the problem statement and common practice, should start from `n * 1` and go up to `n * 10`.
    *   Your current loop prints `n*0` (which is typically not part of a standard table) and omits `n*10`. This mismatch in the expected output lines (both content and quantity) is the main issue.
*   **Output Formatting (Minor):** While functional, the `print` statement `print(str(n) + "*" + str(i), "=", n*i)` combines string concatenation with comma-separated arguments. When using commas, Python's `print()` function automatically inserts a space between arguments. This might lead to a subtle difference in spacing compared to what the automated judge expects (e.g., if it expects `n*i = n*i` with specific spacing or no extra spaces around the equals sign).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Loop Range:**
    The most crucial change is to adjust the `range` in your `for` loop to include numbers from 1 to 10.
    *   Change `for i in range(10):` to `for i in range(1, 11):`.
    This modification will ensure that the loop iterates for `i = 1, 2, ..., 10`, producing the correct lines for the multiplication table.

2.  **Refine Output Formatting (Recommended for consistency and clarity):**
    To ensure the output format precisely matches the judge's expectations and for cleaner code, consider using an f-string or the `sep` parameter in `print()`:

    *   **Using f-string (modern Pythonic approach):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This gives you precise control over spacing and is generally more readable.

    *   **Using `sep` parameter with `print()`:**
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        By setting `sep=""`, you tell `print()` not to insert any default spaces between the arguments, allowing you to define all spaces explicitly within your arguments (e.g., the spaces around `=`).

Applying these changes will resolve the "Wrong Answer" by correctly generating the multiplication table from 1 to 10 and ensure consistent output formatting.
