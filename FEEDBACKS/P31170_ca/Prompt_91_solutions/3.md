This program successfully solves the "Multiplication Table" problem with a clear and efficient approach.

### Problem Summary

The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from `n*1` up to `n*10`. The output for each line should be in the format `n*i = result`.

### Solution Approach

The provided Python program adopts a straightforward and highly effective strategy:

1.  **Input Reading:** It first reads the integer `n` from standard input using `n = int(input())`.
2.  **Iteration:** It then uses a `for` loop, `for i in range(1, 11, 1):`, to generate the multipliers `i` from 1 to 10 (inclusive). The `range(1, 11)` function conveniently provides these numbers.
3.  **Calculation and Output:** Inside the loop, it calculates the product `m = n*i` for the current multiplier. Finally, it prints the complete line `n * i = m` using `print(n,"*",i, " = ", m, sep="")`. The crucial `sep=""` argument ensures that no extra spaces are inserted between the elements printed, matching the exact output format required.

### Code Analysis

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The code correctly computes and displays the multiplication table for `n` from 1 to 10, adhering to the problem's requirements.
    *   **Clarity and Readability:** The program is exceptionally clear and easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`, `m`) are intuitive, and the flow of logic is simple and direct.
    *   **Conciseness and Efficiency:** It's a very concise solution, accomplishing the task in just a few lines of code without any unnecessary complexity. For this problem scale, its efficiency is optimal.
    *   **Pythonic Iteration:** The use of a `for` loop with `range()` is the standard and most Pythonic way to perform a fixed number of iterations.
    *   **Accurate Output Formatting:** The explicit use of `sep=""` in the `print` statement is excellent. This accurately controls the spacing between items, preventing the default space separation and ensuring the output matches the specified format precisely (e.g., `2*5 = 10` rather than `2 * 5 = 10`). This is a detail where many solutions can fall short.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   For a problem of this simplicity, the solution has no significant weaknesses. It is a robust, correct, and well-structured piece of code.

### Suggestions for Improvement

While the current solution is already very good and fully "Accepted," here are a few minor suggestions for refinement or alternative modern Python practices:

1.  **Simplify `range` step:** The `step` argument `1` in `range(1, 11, 1)` is the default value for `range`. You can simplify it to `range(1, 11)` without changing its behavior, making it slightly more concise.
    ```python
    # Current: for i in range (1, 11, 1):
    for i in range(1, 11):
    ```
2.  **Direct Calculation in `print`:** The temporary variable `m` is not strictly necessary. You can perform the multiplication directly within the `print` function:
    ```python
    # Current:
    # m = n*i
    # print(n,"*",i, " = ", m, sep="")

    # Alternative:
    print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
    ```
    This doesn't change functionality but reduces a line of code.
3.  **Use f-strings for Modern Formatting:** For Python 3.6+ (which is widely used now), f-strings provide a very clean and readable way to format strings. They implicitly handle the precise spacing requirements without needing `sep=""`.
    ```python
    # Current: print(n,"*",i, " = ", m, sep="")

    # Alternative using f-string:
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This is often considered the most modern and readable approach for this kind of formatted output.

Overall, the program is an exemplary solution for the given problem, demonstrating good programming practices and a clear understanding of Python fundamentals.
