### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks you to read an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. Your program correctly takes an integer input `a` using `easyinput.read()`. It then iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop, calculating `a * i` in each iteration and attempting to print the multiplication expression along with its result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core logic for generating the multiplication table is sound. You correctly initialize the counter `i` to 1, iterate up to and including 10 (`while i <= 10`), and increment `i` in each step. The multiplication `a * i` is also performed correctly.
    *   **Readability:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, clearly showing the intent of reading input and iterating to print the table.
    *   **Appropriate Loop:** The `while` loop is a perfectly valid choice for this iterative task.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Formatting:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly the output format. When you use `print(a, "*", i, "=", a*i)`, Python's `print` function by default inserts a single space (`sep=' '`) between each argument. This results in an output like `2 * 3 = 6` (with spaces around the asterisk and equals sign). Many online judges expect an exact output format, such as `2*3 = 6` (no spaces around the asterisk, but spaces around the equals sign). The provided problem description often implies such a strict format, even if not explicitly detailed in the text.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Precise Output Formatting:** To fix the "Wrong Answer," you need to ensure the output matches the expected format precisely. You can achieve this using one of the following methods:
    *   **Using `sep=""` with `print()` and strategic string arguments:**
        ```python
        print(a, "*", i, " = ", a*i, sep="")
        ```
        This tells `print` not to add spaces between arguments, so you control where spaces appear by including them in your string literals (e.g., `" = "`). This would produce `2*3 = 6`.

    *   **Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals):** This is generally the most modern and readable way to handle complex string formatting in Python.
        ```python
        print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}")
        ```
        This directly embeds variables into a string, giving you full control over spacing, producing `2*3 = 6`.

*   **Consider a `for` loop (Pythonic alternative):** While your `while` loop is correct, a `for` loop is often preferred in Python for iterating a fixed number of times over a known range.
    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    a = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}")
    ```
    This approach is generally considered more concise and less prone to off-by-one errors with loop counters.

By implementing one of the suggested formatting improvements, your program should produce the correct output and pass the tests.
