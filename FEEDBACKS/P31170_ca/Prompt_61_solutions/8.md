Feedback for the "Taula de multiplicar" program:

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
The provided solution addresses this by first reading the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then employs a `for` loop that iterates through the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive) using `range(1, 11)`. Inside this loop, it calculates the product of `n` and the current loop variable `i`, and prints the expression `n*i = result`.

**2. Code Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and displays all entries of the multiplication table for the given input number `n`.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very straightforward and easy to understand, directly reflecting the problem's requirements.
*   **Efficiency:** For a task of this scope, the solution is highly efficient, performing the necessary calculations and output operations with minimal overhead.
*   **Appropriate Loop Usage:** The `for` loop combined with `range(1, 11)` is an excellent and idiomatic Python choice for iterating through a fixed sequence of numbers.
*   **Correct `easyinput` Usage:** The program correctly uses `easyinput.read(int)` to get the integer input.

**3. Code Weaknesses:**
*   **Output Formatting (Minor):** The main point for minor improvement lies in the output formatting. When `print()` receives multiple arguments separated by commas, it defaults to inserting a space between each argument. In the line `print(str(n)+'*'+str(i),'=', n*i)`, this results in an additional space before the equals sign (e.g., `5*1 = 5` instead of the more standard `5*1 = 5`). While this doesn't affect correctness for "Accepted" status, it's a small detail in presentation.

**4. Suggestions for Improvement:**
To achieve more precise control over the output formatting and eliminate the extra space before the equals sign, consider these more common and robust alternatives for string formatting:

*   **Using `sep=''` with `print()`:** This allows you to explicitly define the separator for `print()`'s arguments. You would then include spaces where you actually want them:
    ```python
    # Example:
    # print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')
    ```
    This would produce output like `5*1 = 5`, giving you full control over the spacing.

*   **Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals):** This is generally considered the most modern, readable, and concise way to format strings in Python (available from Python 3.6 onwards):
    ```python
    # Example:
    # print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This also produces `5*1 = 5` and is highly recommended for its clarity.

*   **Full String Concatenation:** If you prefer to stick with explicit string concatenation using `+`, ensure that the entire line you want to print is constructed as a single string before passing it to `print()`:
    ```python
    # Example:
    # print(str(n) + '*' + str(i) + ' = ' + str(n*i))
    ```
    This would also resolve the spacing issue effectively.

The current solution is effective and correctly solves the problem. The suggestions above focus on refining the output presentation and leveraging more idiomatic Python features for string formatting, which can enhance code readability and maintainability for larger projects.
