This feedback concerns the provided Python program for the "Taula de multiplicar" problem.

### 1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach

The problem requires the program to read a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. For example, if `n` is 5, it should output "5*1 = 5", "5*2 = 10", up to "5*10 = 50".

The submitted program addresses this by:
1.  Reading the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
2.  Initializing a counter variable `i` to 1.
3.  Using a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than 11.
4.  Inside the loop, it calculates `n * i` and prints the result in the specified format `n*i = result`. It uses two `print` statements strategically with `sep=""` and `end=''` to format the output on a single line.
5.  Incrementing the counter `i` by 1 in each iteration to proceed to the next multiplication.

### 2. Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the logic to generate and print the multiplication table as required by the problem statement.
*   **Functionality:** It successfully takes input and produces the correct output for all cases within the specified range (1 to 9). The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
*   **Clarity of Logic (Procedural):** The `while` loop with explicit initialization and increment of the counter is clear and easy to follow for anyone familiar with basic programming constructs.
*   **Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=""` and `end=''` demonstrates an understanding of `print` function parameters to control output spacing and line breaks, successfully achieving the desired format.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Non-Pythonic Loop:** The use of a `while` loop for iterating over a fixed range (`1` to `10`) is generally less Pythonic than using a `for` loop with `range()`. Python's `for` loop is specifically designed for iterating over sequences, which makes the code more concise and readable for this kind of task.
*   **Print Statement Complexity:** Using two `print` statements (one with `end=''`) to construct a single line of output is a bit more verbose than necessary.
*   **Unnecessary Semicolon:** The semicolon after `i = 1;` is syntactically valid in Python but is not standard practice and should generally be avoided for cleaner code.

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

To make the code more Pythonic, concise, and readable, consider the following improvements:

1.  **Use a `for` loop with `range()`:** This is the most significant improvement. It simplifies the loop control.
    ```python
    # Original:
    # i = 1;
    # while(i < 11):
    #     # ...
    #     i = i+1

    # Improved:
    for i in range(1, 11): # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11.
        # ...
    ```

2.  **Simplify Print Statement using f-strings or single `print` with `sep=""`:**
    *   **Using f-strings (most Pythonic for formatting):**
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using a single `print` with `sep=""`:** This achieves the exact output formatting with fewer calls.
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
    Both of these options are clearer and more efficient than the two-`print` statement approach.

3.  **Remove unnecessary semicolon:**
    ```python
    # Original:
    # i = 1;

    # Improved:
    i = 1
    ```

**Revised Example (incorporating suggestions):**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)

# Use a for loop for iterating over a range, which is more Pythonic
for i in range(1, 11):
    # Use an f-string for clear and concise output formatting
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
```

This revised version maintains correctness while significantly improving readability and adhering to more common Python idioms.
