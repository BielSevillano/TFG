**Feedback for "Taula de multiplicar" Program**

**Summary:**
The program correctly addresses the problem of generating a multiplication table for a given natural number `n` (between 1 and 9). It reads the input `n` using `jutge.read()`, then iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive) using a `for` loop. For each iteration, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints the result using an f-string in the format `n * i = n*i`.

**Analysis of Strengths:**
*   **Correct Logic:** The fundamental logic for generating a multiplication table is sound. It correctly initializes `n`, sets up a loop from 1 to 10, and performs the multiplication accurately.
*   **Appropriate Loop Range:** The `range(1, 11)` correctly covers the multipliers from 1 to 10, as required by a standard multiplication table.
*   **Clear Readability:** The use of an f-string (`f"{n} * {i} = {n * i}"`) makes the print statement very readable and intuitive to understand the intended output format.
*   **Correct Input Handling:** It correctly uses `jutge.read()` to get the input and converts it to an integer.

**Analysis of Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
*   **Output Formatting Mismatch:** The "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly due to a subtle difference in the *exact* expected output format. While your current output (e.g., `5 * 1 = 5`) is perfectly logical and readable for a human, automated judging systems are very strict about matching every character, including spaces.
*   Based on common problem expectations and other successful solutions for this task, the judge system likely expects no spaces around the multiplication operator (`*`), but retains spaces around the equals sign (`=`). Your f-string introduces spaces around the `*` (e.g., `5 * 1`), where the expected format is typically `5*1`.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
To resolve the "Wrong Answer" and match the typical expected output format for this problem, you need to adjust the `print` statement to remove the spaces around the multiplication operator.

1.  **Modify the f-string:**
    The simplest fix is to adjust your existing f-string:
    ```python
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n * i}")
    ```
    This change removes the spaces around the `*` symbol, resulting in output like `5*1 = 5`, which is a common expected format.

2.  **Alternatively, use `sep=""` for precise control:**
    Many reference solutions achieve precise formatting by using `print` with multiple arguments and `sep=""`. This explicitly prevents Python from adding default spaces between arguments, allowing you to control every space:
    ```python
    print(n, "*", i, " = ", n * i, sep="")
    ```
    This will also produce output like `5*1 = 5`.

Making this small adjustment to the output formatting should lead to a "Correct Answer."
