Here's a feedback text for the program:

**Feedback for the Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Problem and Solution Summary**

The problem requires writing a program that reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided solution approaches this by first reading the input `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers `i` from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and attempts to print the multiplication expression along with its result.

**2. Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer input `n` using `from easyinput import *` and `n = read(int)`.
*   **Correct Iteration Range:** The `for i in range(1, 11)` loop correctly iterates from 1 up to and including 10, which is the required range for a standard multiplication table.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `s = n*i` accurately computes the product for each step of the table.
*   **Logical Structure:** The use of a loop to generate the table entries is efficient and appropriate for this problem.

**Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**

*   **Output Formatting:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly due to incorrect output formatting. When `print()` is called with multiple arguments separated by commas (e.g., `print(n, "*", i, "=", s)`), Python's `print` function, by default, inserts a single space character (`' '`) between each argument.
    *   This results in output like `3 * 1 = 3` (with spaces around the `*` and `=` signs).
    *   Competitive programming platforms are very strict about exact output matching. The expected format, as implied by most passing solutions, typically involves no spaces around the multiplication operator (`*`) and a single space before and after the equals sign (`=`), e.g., `3*1 = 3`.
    *   The current code's output `str(n) + ' ' + '*' + ' ' + str(i) + ' ' + ' ' + '=' + ' ' + str(s)` introduces extra spaces that deviate from the expected format.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

The core improvement needed is to control the spacing of the output to match the expected format. Here are a couple of ways to achieve this:

*   **Using `sep=""` in `print()` (Recommended for minimal change):**
    By explicitly setting the `sep` (separator) argument of the `print` function to an empty string (`""`), you can prevent `print` from adding default spaces between arguments. You then add spaces manually where they are required.

    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11):
        s = n*i
        # Corrected line:
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", s, sep="") # sep="" removes default spaces, " = " provides the required spacing
    ```

*   **Using f-strings (Modern Pythonic approach):**
    f-strings (formatted string literals) provide a clean and concise way to embed expressions inside string literals and control formatting precisely.

    ```python
    from easyinput import *

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11):
        s = n*i
        # Corrected line:
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {s}") # Directly defines the desired string format
    ```

Implementing either of these changes will ensure that the output format matches the typical requirements for such problems, leading to a "Correct" verdict.
