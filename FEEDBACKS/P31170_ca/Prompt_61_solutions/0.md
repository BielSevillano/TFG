### Feedback: Taula de Multiplicar Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`. The output format needs to be precise, typically `N * I = RESULT`.

**Solution Approach:**
The program correctly identifies the core steps:
1.  Read the input integer `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
2.  Utilize a `for` loop to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10 (`range(1, 11)`).
3.  Inside the loop, calculate the product `n * i`.
4.  Print the expression `n * i = result` for each iteration.

**Code Strengths:**
*   **Correct Logic:** The program correctly implements the main logic to generate a multiplication table from 1 to 10.
*   **Correct Input Handling:** It uses `easyinput.read(int)` to properly read the integer input.
*   **Loop Range:** The `range(1, 11)` correctly covers the desired multipliers from 1 up to and including 10.
*   **Readability:** The code is concise and easy to understand, clearly reflecting the problem's requirements.

**Code Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
The "Wrong Answer" most likely stems from an **incorrect output format**, specifically related to whitespace and newline characters.

1.  **Excess Newline Characters:** When you use `print(n, "*", i, "=", n*i, "\n")`, the `print()` function does two things:
    *   It separates each argument passed (e.g., `n`, `"*"` `i`, `"="`, `n*i`) with a default space (`sep=' '`).
    *   It adds a newline character (`\n`) at the end of the line by default (`end='\n'`).
    *   By explicitly adding `"\n"` as the last argument, you are causing *two* newline characters to be printed after each line of the multiplication table. This results in an extra blank line between each entry, which an automated judge will consider an incorrect format.

    For example, for `n=2`, the output looks like:
    ```
    2 * 1 = 2

    2 * 2 = 4

    ...
    ```
    instead of the expected:
    ```
    2 * 1 = 2
    2 * 2 = 4
    ...
    ```

2.  **Default Spacing:** While less critical than the double newline, relying on `print()`'s default `sep=' '` might introduce more spaces than the judge expects. For example, `2 * 1 = 2` (with single spaces) might be expected, but the default `print` behavior leads to `2 * 1 = 2` (where each comma inserts a space).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the Explicit Newline:** This is the most crucial fix. Remove `"\n"` from your `print` statement. The `print` function will automatically add a single newline character at the end of each line, which is the standard expected behavior.
    ```python
    # Original: print(n,"*", i, "=", n*i,"\n")
    # Corrected:
    print(n,"*", i, "=", n*i)
    ```

2.  **Control Spacing Precisely (Recommended for Judges):** To ensure exact output formatting, it's often best to control spacing explicitly. You can achieve this using the `sep` parameter in `print()` or by using f-strings (formatted string literals).

    *   **Using `sep=""`:** This tells `print()` to use an empty string as a separator between arguments, giving you full control over where spaces appear.
        ```python
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        This would produce `2*1 = 2` if you want no spaces around `*` and exactly one space before and after `=`, or you could adjust spaces within the string literals:
        ```python
        # If the desired output is "N * I = RESULT" with single spaces:
        print(n, " * ", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
        Many of the reference solutions use this method.

    *   **Using f-strings:** This is often the cleanest and most readable way to format output precisely in Python.
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This creates a string like `2*1 = 2`. If spaces are needed around `*` and `=`, just include them directly in the f-string:
        ```python
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")
        ```
        This approach is also widely used in the reference solutions.

By addressing the output formatting, particularly the double newline issue, your program should pass the "Wrong Answer" check and receive an "Accepted" verdict.
