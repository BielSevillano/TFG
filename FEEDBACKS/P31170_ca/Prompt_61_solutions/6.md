### Feedback: Taula de multiplicar

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and outputs its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
The provided solution addresses this by first reading the input number `n` using `easyinput.read()`. It then uses a `for` loop that iterates 10 times. In each iteration, it calculates the product of `n` and the current multiplier (from 1 to 10) and prints the result in the format `n*multiplier = product`.

**2. Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program successfully solves the problem and produced an "Accepted" result, indicating it meets all requirements and provides the correct output format.
    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, directly implementing the logic to generate the multiplication table.
    *   **Conciseness:** It's a compact solution, achieving the goal in a minimal number of lines.
    *   **Appropriate Loop Usage:** The `for` loop is an excellent choice for iterating a fixed number of times (10 multiplications).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Loop Range Convention:** The use of `range(10)` with `i + 1` inside the loop to get multipliers from 1 to 10 is functionally correct but less conventional in Python. Typically, `range(1, 11)` would be used for a loop that directly yields values from 1 to 10, improving readability.
    *   **String Formatting:** The output formatting uses explicit string concatenation (`str(n) + "*" + str(i + 1), "=", n*(i + 1)`). While it works, it can be slightly verbose and less readable than modern Python formatting techniques. The `print` function's default behavior adds spaces between arguments, which means the output might have an extra space before the `=` sign compared to some stricter formatting (e.g., `n*1 = X` vs `n*1 = X`).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Refine Loop Range:** For better readability and idiomatic Python, consider changing the loop to iterate directly from 1 to 10:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11): # i will now go from 1 to 10
        # ... use i directly
    ```
    This removes the need for `i + 1` inside the loop.

*   **Improve Output Formatting:**
    *   **Using f-strings (recommended):** F-strings offer a concise and highly readable way to format output.
        ```python
        # After changing the range to (1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `print` with `sep` argument:** This allows precise control over the separator character between arguments passed to `print`, avoiding unwanted spaces.
        ```python
        # After changing the range to (1, 11):
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```
    Both of these methods lead to cleaner and potentially more efficient string creation compared to explicit concatenation.

By implementing these suggestions, the code would become even more Pythonic and maintainable while retaining its correctness and efficiency.
