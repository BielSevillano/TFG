### Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary**

The problem "Fusió de taules" (Merge tables) requires implementing a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (vectors) of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new sorted list. The resulting list should include all elements from both input lists, preserving duplicates. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should yield `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python solution, `fusio`, correctly implements a standard two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of each input list and an empty `llista_definitiva` for the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller one to the result list and advancing its respective pointer. Once one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list to the result.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm for two sorted lists. It compares elements from both lists and appends them in sorted order to the result, effectively handling duplicates as required.
    *   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(N + M) time, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal as every element from both input lists must be visited at least once.
    *   **Handles Edge Cases:** The `while` loop condition (`i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2)`) and the subsequent `extend` calls (`llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])`) correctly handle scenarios where one or both input lists are empty, or when one list runs out of elements before the other.
    *   **Readability:** The code is clear and uses descriptive variable names (`llista_definitiva`).
    *   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float]`, `-> list[float]`) is excellent practice for code clarity and maintainability.

*   **Weaknesses / Area for Improvement:**
    *   **Presentation Error (Main Program Issue):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is the presence and output of the `main()` function and `llegir_dades()` function. The problem statement explicitly notes: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) This means that **only the `fusio` function should be submitted**. Any other code, especially code that performs input/output operations, will lead to a "Presentation Error" because its output (e.g., `print(n1+n2)`, `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`) does not match the expected format for a solution which typically involves just providing the function implementation.
    *   **Irrelevant Reference Solutions:** The provided reference solutions are for a completely different problem ("Paraules Més Freqüents" - Most Frequent Words) and are not relevant for evaluating this specific "Fusió de taules" problem. They should be disregarded.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Remove the `main` Function and Input/Output Logic:** To resolve the "Presentation Error", remove the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades()` function, and the `from yogi import read` import. The submitted code should consist *only* of the `fusio` function, as specified by the problem.

    **Example of corrected submission:**
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
    This change addresses the "Presentation Error" directly and makes the submission conform to the problem's requirements. The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correct.
