The feedback for your program `fusio` is as follows:

### Problem and Solution Summary

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks you to implement a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of numbers into a single new sorted list. The function should preserve any duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your solution for the `fusio` function correctly implements a standard merge algorithm often used in merge sort. It uses a two-pointer approach, iterating through both input lists simultaneously. In each step, it compares the elements pointed to by the two pointers and appends the smaller one to a new result list, advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends the remaining elements of the other list to the result.

### Code Analysis

**Strengths:**

1.  **Correct `fusio` Logic:** The core `fusio` function is well-implemented and correctly solves the problem as described. It adheres to the problem's requirements for merging two sorted lists while preserving duplicates.
2.  **Efficiency:** The `fusio` function runs in O(N + M) time, where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. This is an optimal time complexity for this problem, as every element from both lists must be processed at least once.
3.  **Readability:** The `fusio` function uses clear variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) and the logic is easy to follow.
4.  **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float] -> list[float]`) is a good practice for code clarity and maintainability.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **"Presentation Error" Cause:** The main reason for the "Presentation Error" is that you submitted a complete program with `main()` and `llegir_dades()` functions, which attempt to read input and print output. The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) This means the testing system expects *only* the `fusio` function definition. Any other code (like `main`, `llegir_dades`, or `from yogi import read`) will cause issues because the test system itself provides the input and calls your `fusio` function.

2.  **Incorrect Output Format (if `main` were allowed):** Even if the `main` function were allowed, its output format would likely be incorrect for the problem.
    *   `print(n1+n2)`: This line prints the total number of elements, which is not part of the expected output format for the merged list.
    *   `print(" ",end="")`: This adds an unnecessary leading space before printing the merged list.
    *   The standard output for a list of numbers is typically just the numbers separated by spaces, without a preceding count or extra leading spaces.

3.  **Type Hint Inconsistency in `llegir_dades` (Minor):** The `llegir_dades` function is type-hinted to return `list[int]` (`def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:`), but it reads `float` values (`x = read(float)`) and appends them to the list. This would make the actual return type `list[float]`. While not the cause of the "Presentation Error" (as `fusio` expects `list[float]`), it's a minor inconsistency.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Crucial Correction:** To fix the "Presentation Error", you *must remove* all code outside of the `fusio` function definition. Your submission should consist solely of the `fusio` function:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

    No `import yogi`, no `main()`, no `llegir_dades()`. The test system will provide `v1` and `v2` as arguments to your `fusio` function and expect it to return the merged list.

By making this key change, your excellent `fusio` implementation should pass the tests.
