### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires merging two pre-sorted lists (or vectors) of floating-point numbers into a single, combined sorted list. A key constraint is that duplicate elements must be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your solution implements the standard **merge algorithm**, often referred to as a "two-pointer" approach. It initializes two pointers, one for each input list, and a new empty list for the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by the two pointers, appending the smaller element to the result list and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one of the input lists is exhausted, all remaining elements from the other list are appended to the result.

**2. Code Analysis**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct and Efficient Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm. This approach is highly efficient for merging sorted lists, having a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. It directly fulfills the problem's requirements of maintaining sorted order and preserving duplicates.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The `fusio` function is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` clearly indicate their purpose.
*   **Pythonic `extend`:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is a concise and efficient way to append the remaining elements from the lists after one has been fully processed.
*   **Type Hinting:** The `fusio` function includes type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float]`, `-> list[float]`), which is excellent practice for code clarity, maintainability, and early error detection.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **"Presentation Error" - Submitting the Entire Program:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that you have submitted the entire program, including the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades()` helper, and the `yogi` imports. The problem statement explicitly says: **"Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat."** This means only the `fusio` function definition should be submitted to the judge. The judge expects to call your `fusio` function directly with its own test data, and any input/output operations or other functions you provide in the submission can cause this error.
*   **Unnecessary Output in `main()`:** Even if the `main()` function were allowed, the line `print(n1+n2)` and `print(" ",end="")` produce output that is not requested by the problem description, contributing to an incorrect output format.
*   **Minor Type Hint Inconsistency in `llegir_dades`:** The function `llegir_dades` is annotated as `->list[int]` but it reads `float` values (`read(float)`). While this is a minor point and not the cause of the current error, it's good to keep type hints consistent with actual behavior.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Crucial Correction (for "Presentation Error"):**
    *   **Remove everything except the `fusio` function definition.** Your submission should consist *only* of the following code:
        ```python
        def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
            i1 = 0
            i2 = 0
            llista_definitiva = []
            while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
                if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                    i1 += 1
                else: # Includes v1[i1] >= v2[i2], correctly handling duplicates
                    llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                    i2 += 1
            llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
            llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
            return llista_definitiva
        ```
    *   The `yogi` import, `llegir_dades` function, and `main` function are for local testing and should not be part of the submitted solution.

*   **Minor Improvements (if you were to keep `main` for local testing):**
    *   Correct the type hint in `llegir_dades` to `-> list[float]`.
    *   Remove the `print(n1+n2)` and `print(" ",end="")` lines from `main()` to ensure the output format matches the problem's implicit requirement (which is likely just the merged list). The line `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` typically prints space-separated values, which is usually the expected format for list outputs.

Your `fusio` function is excellent and correctly solves the core problem. The "Presentation Error" is purely an issue with adhering to the submission guidelines of the platform.
