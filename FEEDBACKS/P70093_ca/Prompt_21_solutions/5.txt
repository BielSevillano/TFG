## Feedback for Program: Fusió de taules

### Problem Summary and Solution Approach:

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function that merges two given sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of floating-point numbers into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The submitted Python program correctly implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm within its `fusio` function. It initializes two pointers (`i1`, `i2`) to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` for the result. It iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller one to `llista_definitiva` and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended to `llista_definitiva`.

### Code Analysis:

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function accurately implements the merge operation for two sorted lists. It successfully combines the elements while maintaining sorted order and correctly handles duplicates, as required by the problem statement.
*   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm used has an optimal time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`, respectively, as it iterates through each element of both input lists at most once.
*   **Readability:** The `fusio` function is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand.
*   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]`) is good practice, enhancing code clarity and maintainability.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Presentation Error (Input/Output Mismatch):** The "Presentation Error" arises because the submitted code includes a `main` function that performs input reading and output printing, which is not expected by the grading system for this specific problem.
    *   The problem statement explicitly notes: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means **only the `fusio` function should be submitted**.
    *   Even if a `main` function were allowed, its output format is incorrect:
        *   It prints `n1+n2` (the total number of elements), which is not part of the expected output.
        *   It prints a leading space (`print(" ",end="")`) before the merged list, which would cause a presentation error if any output at all was expected.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1.  **Remove `main` Function and All Associated I/O:** The most crucial improvement is to remove all code that is not part of the `fusio` function definition. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   The `llegir_dades` helper function.
    *   The entire `main` function.
    *   The call to `main()` at the end of the file.

    The submitted code should strictly contain **only** the `fusio` function as defined in the problem interface. The grading system will call your `fusio` function directly with appropriate inputs and check its return value.

By strictly adhering to the submission guidelines and providing only the requested function, your solution will pass the "Presentation Error" and likely be accepted, as the core `fusio` logic is correct and efficient.
