**Feedback for `fusio` function**

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks you to implement a function named `fusio` that takes two pre-sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of floating-point numbers, `v1` and `v2`, and merges them into a single, new sorted list. Crucially, duplicate elements from either input list must be preserved in the final merged list. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should produce `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

**Solution Approach:**
Your Python program defines the `fusio` function, which employs a standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. The core logic iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to `llista_definitiva` and advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one of the input lists is fully traversed, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended using `extend`.

Beyond the `fusio` function, your program also includes auxiliary functions `llegir_dades` for reading input using `yogi.read` and a `main` function to orchestrate the input, call `fusio`, and print the results.

**Analysis of the Code:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness of `fusio`:** The `fusio` function itself is a correct and robust implementation of the merge algorithm for sorted lists. It accurately handles all elements, including duplicates, and produces a correctly sorted merged list.
*   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach within `fusio` leads to an optimal time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`. This is highly efficient as each element is considered and appended only once.
*   **Readability:** The logic within the `fusio` function is clear and easy to follow, using descriptive variable names like `llista_definitiva` and standard pointer names `i1`, `i2`.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Cause of "Presentation Error":** The most significant issue, which directly leads to the "Presentation Error", is the inclusion of the `main` function and related input/output code (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, `main()`). The problem description explicitly states: **"Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat."** This means you should *only* submit the `fusio` function definition. The platform's automated testing system will handle calling your `fusio` function with appropriate inputs and processing its return value. Any extraneous output or code outside the requested function body will cause a "Presentation Error".
*   **Extraneous Output in `main`:** Even if a `main` function were allowed, your current `main` function prints `n1+n2` and a leading space before the merged list. This output format is not specified by the problem and would also contribute to a "Presentation Error".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove extraneous code:** To fix the "Presentation Error" and comply with the problem's requirements, your submission should only contain the `fusio` function definition. Remove `from yogi import read`, the `llegir_dades` function, and the entire `main` function block.

    Your final submission should look like this:
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **No further improvements are needed for the `fusio` function itself.** It is a well-implemented and efficient solution to the merging problem.
