**Feedback for the `fusio` program**

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem requires implementing a function named `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) as input. The function's goal is to merge these two lists into a single new list that is also sorted, ensuring that all duplicate elements from the original lists are preserved in the final result. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should yield `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The submitted Python solution employs a well-known and efficient "two-pointer" algorithm for merging sorted lists. It initializes two index pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to build the merged result. The core logic involves comparing the elements at `v1[i1]` and `v2[i2]`, appending the smaller of the two to `llista_definitiva`, and advancing the corresponding pointer. This process continues until one of the lists is fully traversed. Finally, any remaining elements in the non-exhausted list are appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness and Efficiency of `fusio`:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merging of two sorted lists while preserving duplicates. The two-pointer approach ensures optimal time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`. Each element from both input lists is visited and processed exactly once.
    *   **Readability:** The code is clear and easy to understand. Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are descriptive. The use of `extend` to add the remaining elements from the lists is Pythonic and efficient.
    *   **Adherence to `fusio` signature:** The function signature `fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]` precisely matches the problem's interface requirements for Python.

*   **Weaknesses (Likely Cause of "Presentation Error"):**
    *   **Output in `main` function:** The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.). This strongly implies that the `main` function should *not* produce any output that is checked by the judge.
        *   The line `print(n1+n2)` outputs the total number of elements, which is extraneous information not requested by the problem for the `fusio` function itself.
        *   The line `print(" ",end="")` outputs an unnecessary leading space before the actual merged list. This is a common cause of "Presentation Error" in competitive programming, as it deviates from the precise output format expected (even if the rest of the output is correct).
        *   While `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` correctly unpacks and prints the elements of the merged list, the preceding extra outputs are problematic.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Strictly adhere to the "main program will be ignored" instruction:** To resolve the "Presentation Error," the most crucial step is to remove or comment out all `print` statements within the `main` function. If the platform truly ignores the `main` function's output, then having `print` statements will not cause issues. However, if it performs a subtle check or considers any extra output an error, removing them is essential.
    ```python
    # def main():
    #     n1 = read(int)
    #     v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
    #     n2 = read(int)
    #     v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
    #     # Remove or comment out these lines:
    #     # print(n1+n2)
    #     # print(" ",end="")
    #     # print(*fusio(v1,v2))
    ```
*   **Simplify `llegir_dades` (Minor):** The `llegir_dades` function can be made more concise using a list comprehension directly in `main`, leveraging `yogi.read`. This is a stylistic improvement and does not affect correctness.
    ```python
    # Original in main:
    # n1 = read(int)
    # v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
    # n2 = read(int)
    # v2 = llegir_dades(n2)

    # Simplified:
    # n1 = read(int)
    # v1 = [read(float) for _ in range(n1)]
    # n2 = read(int)
    # v2 = [read(float) for _ in range(n2)]
    # (The `llegir_dades` function itself could then be removed if no longer used)
    ```

In summary, the `fusio` function is excellently implemented. The "Presentation Error" almost certainly arises from the `main` function generating output (specifically the total count and a leading space) that the automated judge did not expect, given the problem's instruction to ignore the main program.
