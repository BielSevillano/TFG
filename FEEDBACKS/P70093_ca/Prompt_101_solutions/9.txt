### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single new sorted list. The resulting list should contain all elements from both input lists, preserving duplicates, and maintaining sorted order from smallest to largest.

The submitted solution correctly employs a classic **two-pointer merge algorithm**. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of each input list and an empty `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. It iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller one to the result list and advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list to the `llista_definitiva` using list slicing and the `extend` method.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm Implementation:** The `fusio` function accurately implements the two-pointer merge algorithm. It correctly handles element comparisons, duplicate values, and the append logic to produce a perfectly sorted merged list.
    *   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The chosen algorithm is highly efficient, running in O(N1 + N2) time, where N1 and N2 are the lengths of the input lists. This is optimal as every element from both lists must be processed.
    *   **Readability:** The `fusio` function uses clear variable names (e.g., `llista_definitiva`, `i1`, `i2`) and straightforward logic, making it easy to understand.
    *   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float] -> list[float]`) in the `fusio` function is a good practice for code clarity and maintainability.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Presentation Error (Output Format):** The "Presentation Error" arises from the `main` function. The problem statement explicitly mentions "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat" (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored). This means the grader only expects the `fusio` function definition and **no output** from your submitted code. The `main` function's print statements (`print(n1+n2)`, `print(" ",end="")`, `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`) are causing unexpected output and thus the Presentation Error.
    *   **Redundant Code (Main Block and Helper):** The `main` function and the `llegir_dades` helper function are not part of the required solution and should not be submitted. While they don't affect the correctness of `fusio`, they are superfluous given the problem's instructions.
    *   **Minor Type Hint Inconsistency:** In `llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]`, the return type hint `list[int]` is inconsistent with `read(float)`, which suggests it should return `list[float]`. This is minor and only relevant if the function were intended to be part of the final submission.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Remove `main()` and `llegir_dades()`:** The most critical step to resolve the "Presentation Error" and adhere to the problem statement is to remove the entire `main()` function block and the `llegir_dades()` function. Your submission should *only* contain the `fusio` function definition.

    ```python
    from yogi import read # (If 'read' is needed for an internal test, otherwise remove)

    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
    (Note: The `from yogi import read` might also be unnecessary if the grader only calls your `fusio` function directly with lists, not expecting any input reading from your code.)

2.  **Strict Adherence to Problem Interface:** Always review the "Interfície" and "Observació" sections carefully to understand exactly what needs to be submitted and what side effects (like printing) are allowed or expected. For programming contest problems, "Presentation Error" almost always points to incorrect output format or unexpected output.

The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and demonstrates a solid understanding of the required algorithm. The issues are entirely related to extraneous code and output.
