Here's a feedback text for your program:

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" asks for a function that merges two already sorted lists (or vectors/arrays in other languages), `v1` and `v2`, into a new single sorted list. The merged list should contain all elements from both input lists, preserving duplicates, and maintain the ascending order. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python code implements the `fusio` function using a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. The core logic involves iterating while both pointers are within their respective list bounds, comparing the elements `v1[i1]` and `v2[i2]`. The smaller element is appended to `llista_definitiva`, and its corresponding pointer is advanced. Once one of the lists is fully traversed, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended to `llista_definitiva` using list slicing and the `extend` method.

**Code Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm, which is the standard and most efficient approach for merging two sorted lists.
*   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in linear time, O(len(v1) + len(v2)), as each element from both input lists is visited and appended to the result list exactly once. This is an optimal solution in terms of time complexity.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are descriptive and make the code easy to understand.
*   **Handles Edge Cases:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` correctly handles scenarios where one input list is fully consumed before the other, ensuring all remaining elements are added to the final list.

**Code Weaknesses and Reason for "Presentation Error":**
*   **Violation of Submission Instructions:** The problem statement explicitly specifies: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored). Your submission includes the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades` helper function, and the `from yogi import read` import. This entire main program structure is extraneous to the requested `fusio` function. Online judges often produce a "Presentation Error" (or similar output format error) if the submission contains code beyond the specified function, as it can generate unexpected output or interfere with the judge's execution environment.
*   **Unnecessary Output in `main`:** The `main` function prints `n1+n2` and then ` " ",end=""` before printing the merged list. The problem for `fusio` only requires the function to return a list, not to print anything. This extra output would also contribute to a "Presentation Error" if the judge expects no output or a different format.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Submit Only the Requested Function:** The most crucial improvement is to remove all code outside of the `fusio` function. Your submission should strictly adhere to the interface provided and only include the `fusio` definition:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Avoid External Libraries for Input (unless specified):** While `yogi` is used in some educational platforms, competitive programming platforms typically expect standard input/output (`input()` for Python). For problems that require only a function, input/output handling is managed by the judge system, so explicitly importing `yogi.read` would be unnecessary and could lead to errors if the library is unavailable.

By making these changes, your solution for the `fusio` function should pass, as the core logic is efficient and correct.
