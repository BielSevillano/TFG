### Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers, `v1` and `v2`, as input. The function should merge these two lists into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements, and return the resulting merged list. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to the beginning of `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`. The smaller of the two elements is appended to `llista_definitiva`, and its corresponding pointer is advanced. If elements are equal, the element from `v2` is chosen first (due to the `else` condition), then the element from `v1` will be considered in the next iteration, correctly preserving both duplicates. After one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Strengths:**

1.  **Correct `fusio` Logic:** The core `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm for two sorted lists, respecting the condition of not removing duplicates. Its time complexity is optimal, O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists.
2.  **Clear Variable Names:** Variable names like `llista_definitiva` are descriptive and enhance readability.
3.  **Efficiency in Appending:** Using `list.extend()` for appending remaining elements is an efficient way to add multiple elements from an iterable.
4.  **Type Hinting:** The `fusio` function includes type hints, which is good practice for code clarity and maintainability.

**Code Weaknesses & Reason for "Presentation Error":**

1.  **Incorrect Submission Format:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that the problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means **only the `fusio` function** should be submitted. The provided code includes a `main` function, a helper `llegir_dades` function, and uses `yogi.read()` and `print()` statements for input/output. The automated grading system expects only the function definition and will test it directly with predefined inputs, not run a complete program. Any output generated by the `main` function or reliance on `yogi.read` will cause a Presentation Error.

2.  **Unnecessary Output in `main`:** Even if a `main` function were permitted, the output generated is not as expected.
    *   `print(n1+n2)`: This line prints the sum of the lengths of the input lists, which is not requested by the problem description.
    *   `print(" ",end="")`: This adds an extra leading space before the merged list, which is typically not desired and contributes to a Presentation Error.

3.  **Type Hint Inconsistency in `llegir_dades`:** The function `llegir_dades` reads floats (`read(float)`) but its return type hint is `list[int]`. It should be `list[float]` to accurately reflect the data it's handling.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Submit Only the Required Function:** The most crucial step is to **remove the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades()` function, and all `yogi.read()` and `print()` calls** from your submission. Only the `fusio` function, as defined by the problem's interface, should be present.
2.  **Correct Type Hint (if keeping `llegir_dades` for local testing):** If you decide to keep `llegir_dades` for local testing purposes, update its type hint to `def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]:` to reflect that it reads and stores floats.

By addressing the submission format and removing the extraneous I/O code, your `fusio` function should pass the tests, as its core logic is sound and efficient.
