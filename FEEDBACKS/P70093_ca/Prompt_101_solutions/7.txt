### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires implementing a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single new sorted list. Crucially, duplicate elements must be preserved. The provided solution correctly approaches this problem using a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements and appending the smaller one to a new result list until one of the input lists is exhausted. Finally, it appends any remaining elements from the non-exhausted list.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function implements the standard and efficient two-pointer merge algorithm, which is perfectly suited for this problem. It correctly handles the sorted input and preserves duplicates.
    *   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The `fusio` function has a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal as every element from both input lists must be visited at least once.
    *   **Clear and Readable:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are descriptive, and the logic within the `fusio` function is easy to follow.
    *   **Adherence to Function Signature:** The `fusio` function's signature matches the problem's interface specification.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **"Presentation Error" Cause (Main Program Issue):** The "Presentation Error" is not due to an error in the `fusio` function's logic, but rather in the accompanying `main` program and its output format. The problem statement explicitly notes: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means the judging system expects *only* the `fusio` function (and any helper functions it directly calls within its scope, which `fusio` does not have in this case) and will ignore any `main` block or input/output operations.
    *   **Superfluous Output:** Even if a `main` program were expected, the current `main` function prints the sum of the lengths (`n1+n2`) and a leading space before printing the merged list, which are not part of the required output format. This extra output is the direct cause of the "Presentation Error".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the `main` function and I/O logic:** The primary fix for the "Presentation Error" is to remove the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades` helper function, the `from yogi import read` line, and the final `main()` call. Your submission should *only* consist of the `fusio` function.
    ```python
    # This is all that should be submitted for the function 'fusio':
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], correctly placing v2[i2] first
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Adhere to Problem Specifications:** Always pay close attention to the "Observació" or similar notes in problem statements, especially on competitive programming platforms. They often indicate that only specific function definitions are required, and any additional code (like a `main` block for testing input/output) will lead to errors.

The `fusio` function itself is excellent and directly solves the problem's core logic. Once the extraneous `main` program is removed, the solution should pass.
