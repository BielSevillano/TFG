### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" (Table Fusion) asks for a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of numbers into a single new sorted list. The result should include all elements from both input lists, preserving duplicates, and maintaining the ascending order. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should yield `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem statement explicitly mentions that the input lists are already sorted in ascending order.

The chosen solution approach is the standard two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It initializes two pointers, one for each input list, and an empty list for the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by the two pointers, appending the smaller one to the result list and advancing its respective pointer. Once one of the input lists is exhausted, all remaining elements from the other list are simply appended to the result. This is an optimal approach for this problem.

**Code Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Logic for `fusio` function:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists efficiently, handles cases where elements are equal (appending `v2`'s element first, which is perfectly valid), and correctly appends any remaining elements from either list at the end. This ensures the final list is sorted and contains all elements.
2.  **Efficiency:** The `fusio` function runs in linear time, O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. It also uses O(N + M) space for the new merged list, which is optimal.
3.  **Readability:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are clear and descriptive.
4.  **Type Hints:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `-> list[float]`) is good practice for code clarity and maintainability in Python.

**Code Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

The "Presentation Error" result typically means that the program's output format does not exactly match what the judge system expects, even if the core logic is correct. In this specific problem, the crucial "Observació" states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.)

The primary weakness is not in the `fusio` function itself, but in the `main` block's output:

1.  **Extra Output in `main`:** The line `print(n1+n2)` outputs the sum of the lengths of the two input lists. This is not part of the problem's expected output format (based on the example given, which only shows the merged list). This line is almost certainly the cause of the "Presentation Error."
2.  **Leading Space in `main`'s Output:** The line `print(" ",end="")` prints an unnecessary leading space before the merged list. While `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` correctly prints the elements separated by spaces, this initial space is likely an unexpected character, contributing to the "Presentation Error."
3.  **Submission Scope:** As per the problem's observation, only the `fusio` function should be submitted. Any code outside this function (like `main`, `llegir_dades`, and the `yogi` imports) should be removed for submission to such a platform. The judge only compiles/tests the specified function signature.
4.  **Minor Type Hint Inconsistency in `llegir_dades`:** The function `llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]` is type-hinted to return a list of integers, but it reads `float`s (`x = read(float)`). This is a minor inconsistency that could be corrected to `->list[float]`.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **For Submission:**
    *   **Remove the `main` function and its calls.**
    *   **Remove the `llegir_dades` function.**
    *   **Remove `from yogi import read`.**
    *   Submit *only* the `def fusio(...)` block.

*   **If the `main` function were to be included for local testing and debugging, the output format should be adjusted as follows:**
    *   Remove `print(n1+n2)`.
    *   Remove `print(" ",end="")`.
    *   The line `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` is generally correct for printing space-separated elements, assuming no leading/trailing spaces are expected. If a specific separator or format is required (e.g., `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`), `print(str(fusio(v1,v2))[1:-1].replace(',', ''))` or similar formatting would be needed, but `*list` is common for space-separated elements.

In summary, the core merging logic in your `fusio` function is robust and correct. The "Presentation Error" likely stems from including extraneous output and code beyond the specified function for submission. Once these extraneous parts are removed, the `fusio` function should pass correctly.
