**Feedback for `Fusió de taules`**

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) as input. Its task is to merge these two lists into a single, new list that is also sorted in ascending order, ensuring that all duplicate elements are preserved.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided `fusio` function implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It uses two index variables, `i1` and `i2`, to iterate through `v1` and `v2` respectively. In each step, it compares the elements at the current indices of `v1` and `v2`. The smaller element is appended to a new list called `llista_definitiva`, and its corresponding index is incremented. This process continues until one of the input lists is fully traversed. Finally, any remaining elements from the unexhausted list are appended to `llista_definitiva`.

The provided program also includes a `main` function that handles reading input (list sizes `n1`, `n2` and their elements `v1`, `v2`) using a helper function `llegir_dades`. It then calls the `fusio` function and attempts to print the sum of the input list lengths, followed by the elements of the merged list.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct and Efficient Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm for sorted lists. This approach is optimal, achieving a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`, respectively.
*   **Handles Duplicates and Remaining Elements:** The algorithm correctly preserves all duplicate elements as required by the problem statement. The use of `extend` after the main loop effectively handles cases where one list is longer than the other, ensuring all elements from both input lists are included in the final merged result.
*   **Readability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).
*   **Type Hinting:** The function signature includes type hints (`v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]`), which is a good practice for code clarity and maintainability in Python.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Violation of Submission Requirements (Primary Cause of "Presentation Error"):** The problem statement explicitly specifies: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) This means that the submission should **only contain the definition of the `fusio` function**. The presence of the `from yogi import read` import, the `llegir_dades` helper function, the entire `main` function, and any input/output operations (`cin`, `cout`, `print`) are extraneous and are the direct cause of the "Presentation Error". The automated judging system typically isolates and tests only the requested function.
*   **Output Format in `main` (if `main` was implicitly part of testing):** Even if the `main` function were somehow expected, its output format—printing `n1+n2` on one line, followed by a space, and then the merged list elements—is non-standard for such problems and would likely lead to a "Presentation Error" if the expected output was simply the space-separated elements of the merged list.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Remove All Extraneous Code:** The most crucial step is to delete all code except for the `fusio` function definition. Your submission should look like this:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], ensuring stability or preference for v2 if equal
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        
        # Append any remaining elements from v1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        
        # Append any remaining elements from v2
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
    By doing this, your solution will conform to the submission requirements and pass the "Presentation Error".
