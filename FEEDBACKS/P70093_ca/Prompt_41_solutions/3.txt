### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to merge two already sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of numbers into a single new list, maintaining the sorted order and preserving all duplicate elements. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The precondition states that the input lists `v1` and `v2` are already sorted in ascending order.

The submitted Python `fusio` function employs a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, for `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva`. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller one to `llista_definitiva` and advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one of the input lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm. This approach is highly efficient for merging sorted lists, having a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. It correctly handles duplicates and maintains the sorted order.
    *   **Readability:** The code within the `fusio` function is well-structured and uses clear, descriptive variable names (e.g., `llista_definitiva`, `i1`, `i2`), making it easy to understand.
    *   **Pythonic Use of `extend`:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` for adding remaining elements is idiomatic and efficient Python.

*   **Weaknesses / Reason for "Presentation Error":**
    *   **Violation of Submission Requirements:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that the problem statement explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Your submission includes a `main()` function, an auxiliary `llegir_dades()` function, and uses `yogi.read` for input, which is not expected by the automatic grader for this type of problem.
    *   **Incorrect Output Format (in `main`):** Even if a `main` function were allowed, its output format is incorrect for a typical competitive programming problem.
        *   `print(n1+n2)`: Printing the sum of the lengths of the input arrays (`n1+n2`) is not requested and would cause a "Presentation Error".
        *   `print(" ",end="")`: This prints an extra leading space before the merged list, which is usually not desired and leads to "Presentation Error". The problem simply expects the merged elements separated by spaces.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adhere to Submission Instructions:** The most critical step is to **remove the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and any `yogi.read` imports or calls.** Submit *only* the `fusio` function as it is the "procediment demanat".

    ```python
    # This is the only part that should be submitted for the problem
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Covers v1[i1] >= v2[i2]
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

2.  **Self-Correction for `main` (if it were allowed):** If this were a problem requiring a full program with I/O, the `main` function should be adjusted to produce the correct output format, e.g., only printing the merged list elements separated by spaces:
    ```python
    # This part should NOT be submitted, but shows how to fix the output if a main was needed.
    from yogi import read

    def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[float]: # Changed type hint to float
        L = []
        for i in range(n):
            x = read(float)
            L.append(x)
        return L

    def main():
        n1 = read(int)
        v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
        n2 = read(int)
        v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
        
        # Corrected output for a typical problem asking for merged list
        # Simply print the elements of the resulting list
        print(*fusio(v1, v2)) 

    # main() # Keep this if you want to test locally, but remove for submission
    ```

By following the first suggestion, your `fusio` function, which is already well-implemented and correct, should pass the problem.
