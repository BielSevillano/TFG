### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" (Merge Tables/Vectors) requires implementing a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (vectors) of floating-point numbers into a single sorted list. The key constraint is that duplicate elements must be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python program correctly implements a standard **two-pointer merge algorithm** within the `fusio` function. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements at the current pointers and appending the smaller element to a new result list. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are simply appended to the result.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The `fusio` function accurately implements the merge operation for two sorted lists, respecting the requirement to keep duplicates. The two-pointer approach correctly handles all comparison cases and the appending of remaining elements.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` has a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. This is optimal for this problem, as every element from both lists must be visited at least once.
    *   **Readability:** Variable names like `i1`, `i2` (for indices of `v1` and `v2`) and `llista_definitiva` are clear and easy to understand.
    *   **Adherence to `fusio` Interface:** The `fusio` function itself matches the specified interface `fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]`.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Presentation Error Cause:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is almost certainly the inclusion of the `main` function and associated input/output operations (`read`, `print`). The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored). This means the system expects *only* the `fusio` function definition. Any other code, especially input reading or output printing, will cause a "Presentation Error" if it doesn't match a very specific (and usually unstated) test harness output, or if it simply produces unexpected output.
    *   **`llegir_dades` Type Hint Inconsistency (Minor, if kept):** If the `llegir_dades` function were intended to be kept, its type hint `->list[int]` is inconsistent with `read(float)` and the `fusio` function's expectation of `list[float]`. However, this function (and `main`) should be removed anyway.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Essential Improvement (To fix "Presentation Error"):**
    *   **Remove the `main()` function and the `llegir_dades()` helper function.** Submit *only* the `fusio` function definition. This is the standard practice for many online judge platforms when a specific function interface is provided.

*   **No Algorithmic Improvements Needed for `fusio`:** The `fusio` function itself is already very well-implemented and efficient, so no further algorithmic changes are necessary for its core logic.

By removing the extraneous `main` and `llegir_dades` functions, the submission should pass the "Presentation Error" and correctly solve the problem.
