### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" (Table Merge) requires implementing a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (or vectors) of floating-point numbers into a single, combined sorted list. The key constraint is to retain all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your `fusio` function correctly implements the standard two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements and appending the smaller one to a new result list. If elements are equal, it picks one, then the other, ensuring all duplicates are preserved. After one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct `fusio` implementation:** The core `fusio` function is robust and correctly merges two sorted lists while preserving duplicates. Its logic is sound and adheres to the problem's requirements for the merge operation itself.
    *   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The `fusio` function has an optimal time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists, as it only iterates through each element once.
    *   **Readability:** The code for the `fusio` function is clear and easy to understand.
    *   **Modular Design:** Separating input reading (`llegir_dades`) from the core logic (`fusio`) is good practice.

*   **Weaknesses (Leading to "Presentation Error"):**
    *   **Incorrect Submission Format:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that your submission includes a `main` function and associated input/output operations (`read`, `print`, `llegir_dades`). The problem statement explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means the judge expects *only* the `fusio` function to be submitted, and it will call this function with its own test data. Any additional code, especially code that produces output, will cause a "Presentation Error" because the output produced by your `main` function doesn't match the judge's expectations (which is usually no output from the user's side if only a function is requested).
    *   **Unnecessary Output in `main`:** Even if a `main` function were allowed, the specific output format `print(n1+n2)` followed by `print(" ",end="")` and then `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` is unlikely to match a standard expected output. Typically, a merged list would be printed directly, perhaps space-separated, but usually without an explicit count of elements first, or a leading space.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Submit Only the `fusio` Function:** The most critical step to resolve the "Presentation Error" is to remove the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and all `yogi.read` and `print` statements from your submission. Your file should only contain the definition of the `fusio` function:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # This covers v1[i1] >= v2[i2], correctly handling equal elements
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Pay Close Attention to Submission Instructions:** Always carefully read the "Observació" or similar sections in problem statements. They often contain vital information about what exactly needs to be submitted and how.

Your `fusio` function is well-written and solves the core problem effectively. The issue is purely with the surrounding code and submission format.
