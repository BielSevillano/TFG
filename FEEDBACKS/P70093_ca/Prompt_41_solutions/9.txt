### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" (Table Merge) requires implementing a function `fusio` that takes two pre-sorted lists of numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your solution for the `fusio` function correctly implements the standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements and appending the smaller one to a new result list. Once one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends the remaining elements of the other list.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the classic merge algorithm for sorted lists. This approach guarantees the resulting list is sorted and includes all elements from both input lists, including duplicates.
*   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm used in `fusio` has a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`. This is optimal as every element from both lists must be visited at least once.
*   **Readability (Core Logic):** The logic within the `fusio` function is clear and easy to follow, making it maintainable and understandable.
*   **Pythonic Use of `extend`:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an efficient and Pythonic way to handle the remaining elements after one of the lists has been fully processed.
*   **Modular Design (Overall Program):** Separating the core logic (`fusio`), input reading (`llegir_dades`), and program execution (`main`) is good practice, making the code more organized.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Violation of Submission Instructions (Primary Issue):** The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) The most common reason for a "Presentation Error" in such cases is submitting the `main()` function (and related input/output code like `llegir_dades` and `yogi` import) when only the `fusio` function is expected. The judging system likely only compiles/tests the `fusio` function and ignores everything else, or it might encounter issues with unexpected code or output.
*   **Type Hint Inaccuracy:** In `llegir_dades`, the type hint `->list[int]` is incorrect. Since `read(float)` is used to read floating-point numbers, the return type should be `list[float]`. (This function, however, should be removed as per the submission instructions.)
*   **Output Formatting (If `main` were relevant):** If, contrary to the instructions, the `main` function's output *were* being evaluated, its format would be problematic:
    *   Printing `n1+n2` (the total count) is not explicitly requested as part of the merged list output.
    *   `print(" ",end="")` adds an unnecessary leading space before the merged list, which would cause a format mismatch.
*   **Variable Naming (Minor):** While functional, using English variable names (e.g., `result_list`, `index1`, `index2`) would make the code more universally understandable.
*   **Tie-breaking (Minor):** When `v1[i1] == v2[i2]`, the current `else` branch `llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])` means the element from `v2` is appended first. If stable merging (where elements from `v1` must precede equal elements from `v2`) were a requirement, the condition would need to be `if v1[i1] <= v2[i2]`. For this problem, it's generally not a critical concern.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Strictly Follow Submission Guidelines:**
    *   **Remove `main()` and `llegir_dades()`:** The most important action is to remove the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and `from yogi import read`. Your submission should *only* contain the `fusio` function definition. This is almost certainly the cause of your "Presentation Error".
    *   Example of what to submit:
        ```python
        def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
            i1 = 0
            i2 = 0
            llista_definitiva=[]
            while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
                if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                    i1 += 1
                else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2]
                    llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                    i2 += 1
            llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
            llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
            return llista_definitiva
        ```

2.  **Correct Type Hinting (if `llegir_dades` were kept):** If `llegir_dades` were meant to be part of a full program, ensure its type hint is accurate: `def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]:`.

3.  **Improve Variable Naming (Optional but Recommended):** Consider using English variable names for broader understanding, e.g.:
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        idx1 = 0
        idx2 = 0
        merged_list = []
        while idx1 < len(v1) and idx2 < len(v2):
            if v1[idx1] < v2[idx2]:
                merged_list.append(v1[idx1])
                idx1 += 1
            else:
                merged_list.append(v2[idx2])
                idx2 += 1
        merged_list.extend(v1[idx1:])
        merged_list.extend(v2[idx2:])
        return merged_list
    ```

Your `fusio` function itself is a solid and efficient solution to the problem. The "Presentation Error" very likely stems from including the `main` program despite instructions to ignore it. Focus on submitting only the requested function.
