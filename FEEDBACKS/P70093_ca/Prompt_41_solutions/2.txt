**Feedback for "Fusió de taules" program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function that merges two given sorted lists (or vectors) of numbers into a single, new sorted list. It's crucial that all elements, including any duplicates, are preserved in the resulting merged list. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` with `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should produce `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The submitted Python program successfully implements the `fusio` function using the standard two-pointer merge algorithm. This approach involves:
*   Initializing two pointers (`i1` and `i2`), one for each input list (`v1` and `v2`).
*   Iteratively comparing the elements at the current positions of `v1[i1]` and `v2[i2]`.
*   Appending the smaller element to a new list, `llista_definitiva`, and advancing the corresponding pointer. If elements are equal, the element from `v2` is chosen first (due to the `else` condition handling `>=`).
*   Once one of the input lists has been fully processed, all remaining elements from the other list are efficiently appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function precisely implements the classic merge algorithm for sorted lists. It correctly handles duplicate elements and guarantees that the resulting list `llista_definitiva` is also sorted.
*   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm used has a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. This is an optimal solution, as every element in both lists must be examined at least once.
*   **Readability and Clarity (of `fusio` function):** The `fusio` function is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` clearly indicate their purpose.
*   **Pythonic Handling of Remaining Elements:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant, concise, and efficient Pythonic way to append any elements that were not processed during the main `while` loop.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **"Presentation Error" - Incorrect Submission Scope:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that the problem statement explicitly requests: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means **only the `fusio` function** should be submitted. Your submission includes a `main()` function, input reading (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`), and output formatting, which is outside the scope of what was asked.
    *   Specifically, the `print(n1+n2)` line outputs additional information (the total count of elements) not expected in the final output.
    *   The `print(" ",end="")` line adds an unwanted leading space before the merged list.
*   **Extraneous Code:** The `from yogi import read` import and the entire `llegir_dades` and `main` functions are part of a testing harness, not the required solution. Submitting them introduces code that the platform's judging system isn't expecting for the function itself.
*   **Minor Type Hint Discrepancy (in `llegir_dades`):** Although this function should be removed, for completeness, note that the type hint `->list[int]` in `llegir_dades` is inconsistent with `read(float)` and appending `float` values. It should be `->list[float]`.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Crucial: Adhere to Submission Requirements:** The most critical step to resolve the "Presentation Error" and successfully pass the problem is to **submit only the `fusio` function**. Remove all other code from your submission, including:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   The definition of `llegir_dades`
    *   The definition of `main`
    *   The call `main()`

    Your final submission file should ideally look like this:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # This branch covers v1[i1] >= v2[i2]
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

The `fusio` function itself is excellent; the issues lie entirely with the surrounding code and output format, which are not part of the required submission.
