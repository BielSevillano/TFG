**Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program**

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks for a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of numbers, `v1` and `v2`, into a single, new sorted list. Crucially, duplicate elements must be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` with `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your solution employs the classic two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It initializes two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. The core logic involves comparing the elements at `v1[i1]` and `v2[i2]`, appending the smaller one to `llista_definitiva`, and advancing the corresponding pointer. This continues until one of the lists is exhausted. Finally, any remaining elements from the other list are appended. This is an optimal and widely accepted approach for merging sorted lists.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm Implementation:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm. It accurately combines the two sorted lists into a single sorted list, preserving all elements and their order, including duplicates.
    *   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(N + M) time, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`. This is optimal because every element from both input lists must be examined at least once.
    *   **Readability and Conciseness:** The `fusio` function is well-structured, easy to understand, and uses clear variable names (`llista_definitiva`, `i1`, `i2`). The use of `extend(v1[i1:])` and `extend(v2[i2:])` for handling remaining elements is Pythonic and efficient.
    *   **Adherence to Function Signature:** The `fusio` function's signature `fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]` perfectly matches the problem's interface requirements for Python.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **"Presentation Error" Cause:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is the inclusion of the `main()` function, `llegir_dades()` function, and the `from yogi import read` statement in your submission. The problem statement explicitly notes: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.). Competitive programming judges often expect only the requested function(s) and any necessary imports *for those functions*. When a full program with I/O is submitted, its execution might produce unexpected output or attempt to read unexpected input, leading to a Presentation Error.
    *   **Extraneous Output in `main` (if it were allowed):** Even if a `main` function were permitted, the line `print(n1+n2)` generates output not specified by the problem. Additionally, `print(" ",end="")` before `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` adds an extra leading space before the merged list, which is a common cause of Presentation Errors as output formats are usually strict.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Non-Function Code:** The most crucial improvement is to remove the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades()` function, and the `from yogi import read` import. Your submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function definition:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], ensuring stability for equal elements
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
    This change will align your submission with the problem's requirements and should resolve the "Presentation Error".

Your `fusio` function itself is excellently implemented and demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem and an efficient solution strategy. The issue is solely with the surrounding driver code.
