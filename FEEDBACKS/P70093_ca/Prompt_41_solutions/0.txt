## Feedback on your "Fusió de taules" program

### 1. Problem Summary

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks you to implement a function that merges two given sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) `v1` and `v2` into a single new sorted list. The key requirement is to preserve all duplicate elements. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists `v1` and `v2` are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

### 2. Solution Approach

Your `fusio` function correctly implements the classic two-pointer merge algorithm for sorted lists. This approach involves:
1.  Initializing an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result.
2.  Using two index pointers (`i1` and `i2`), one for each input list (`v1` and `v2`), both starting at the beginning (index 0).
3.  In a `while` loop, you compare the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`.
    *   If `v1[i1]` is smaller than `v2[i2]`, `v1[i1]` is appended to `llista_definitiva`, and `i1` is incremented.
    *   Otherwise (if `v2[i2]` is smaller or equal to `v1[i1]`), `v2[i2]` is appended, and `i2` is incremented. This handles duplicates correctly by preserving the original relative order.
4.  After the main loop finishes (meaning one of the lists has been exhausted), you append any remaining elements from `v1` (if `i1` hasn't reached the end) and then any remaining elements from `v2` (if `i2` hasn't reached the end) to `llista_definitiva`.
5.  Finally, the `llista_definitiva` is returned.

### 3. Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm Implementation:** The `fusio` function's logic is sound and correctly implements the merge algorithm for sorted lists while preserving duplicates. This is the optimal approach for this problem given the preconditions.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm runs in O(N + M) time complexity, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is highly efficient as it requires only a single pass through both lists.
*   **Readability:** The code is clean, well-structured, and uses descriptive variable names (`llista_definitiva`, `i1`, `i2`), making it easy to understand.
*   **Pythonic Use of `extend`:** Using `extend(v1[i1:])` and `extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant and efficient way to handle the remaining elements of the lists after the main merge loop.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Irrelevant Main Program Block:** The problem statement explicitly notes: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means that only the `fusio` function itself should be submitted. Including the `main` function, input reading (`llegir_dades` using `yogi.read`), and output printing is unnecessary and often leads to issues in automated judging systems.
*   **Output Format Discrepancy (Cause of "Presentation Error"):** This is the direct cause of your "Presentation Error". The problem asks for the merged list as output, but your `main` function prints:
    1.  The sum of the lengths of the two input lists (`n1 + n2`).
    2.  A leading space (`" "`).
    3.  The elements of the merged list.

    For example, if the merged list is `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`, your program would output:
    ```
    7
     2 3 3 5 5 5 7
    ```
    The expected output is likely just the merged list on a single line, space-separated, without the total count or the leading space, e.g.:
    ```
    2 3 3 5 5 5 7
    ```

    The other provided solutions are not relevant to this specific problem ("Fusió de taules") as they seem to address a "word frequency" problem. Therefore, they are not used for comparison here.

### 4. Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Submit Only the `fusio` Function:** The most important suggestion is to remove the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and any `yogi` imports. Your submission should consist solely of the `fusio` function definition, as requested by the problem statement.

    ```python
    # This is what you should submit:
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Handles v2[i2] <= v1[i1], preserving order for duplicates
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

2.  **Correct Output Formatting (if `main` were allowed):** If, for local testing purposes, you wanted to keep a `main` function, you would need to adjust the output to match the expected format more precisely.

    ```python
    from yogi import read # Keep this if you need yogi for local testing

    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        # ... (your existing fusio function)
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva =[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva

    def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:
        """Llegeix tots els nombres i els afegeix a la llista"""
        L = []
        for i in range(n):
            x = read(float)
            L.append(x)
        return L

    def main():
        n1 = read(int)
        v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
        n2 = read(int)
        v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
        # Corrected output for testing:
        # Remove the print(n1+n2) line
        # Remove the print(" ", end="") line
        print(*fusio(v1,v2)) # This prints elements space-separated on one line
    
    # main() # Call main() for local testing, but remove for submission
    ```

By following the first suggestion, you should resolve the "Presentation Error" and successfully pass the problem, as your core `fusio` logic is already correct and efficient.
