### Feedback for Program: `fusio.py`

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" (Table Merge) asks for a function that merges two already sorted lists (vectors) of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new list. The resulting list must also be sorted from smallest to largest, and all duplicate elements from both original lists must be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should yield `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem specifies the function signature `fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]` and states that only this procedure should be submitted; the main program will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The student's `fusio` function implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It uses two index variables (`i1` and `i2`) to traverse `v1` and `v2` respectively. In a `while` loop, it compares the elements currently pointed to by `i1` and `i2`. The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva`, and its corresponding pointer is incremented. If elements are equal, `v2[i2]` is chosen (which implicitly handles `v1[i1]` on the next iteration), preserving order and duplicates. After one of the lists is fully traversed, any remaining elements from the other list are appended using `extend`.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct `fusio` function:** The core logic of the `fusio` function is perfectly correct and efficiently implements the merging of two sorted lists while preserving duplicates. This is a standard and optimal approach (O(N+M) time complexity).
    *   **Clear variable names:** Variable names like `llista_definitiva`, `i1`, `i2` are descriptive and easy to understand within the context of the algorithm.
    *   **Proper handling of remaining elements:** The use of `extend(v1[i1:])` and `extend(v2[i2:])` is a clean and Pythonic way to append any leftover elements after the main merge loop finishes.

*   **Weaknesses & Cause of "Presentation Error":**
    *   **Unnecessary `main` function output:** The problem explicitly states, "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) This means any code outside the `fusio` function, particularly the `main` function and its output, is extraneous to the submission. The `main` function in the provided code prints the sum of the lengths (`n1+n2`) and a leading space before the merged list. This additional output, which is not expected according to the problem statement, is the direct cause of the "Presentation Error". The judging system expects *only* the output generated by calling `fusio` and nothing else.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove extraneous code for submission:** To fix the "Presentation Error", delete the `llegir_dades` function and the entire `main()` block from the submission. Only the `fusio` function should be present in the submitted file.

    ```python
    # This is the only part that should be submitted
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], correctly choosing v2[i2] first if equal
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Local Testing Practices (if `main` were allowed):** If a `main` function *were* necessary for local testing (even if ignored by the judge), ensure its output exactly matches any specified format. In this case, `print(n1+n2)` should be removed, and the `print(" ",end="")` should also be removed to avoid an unnecessary leading space. A typical output for a list of floats would be just `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`.

The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correctly solves the merging problem. The issue is purely related to the submission format and the presence of unrequested output.
