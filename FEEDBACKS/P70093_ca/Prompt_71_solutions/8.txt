### Feedback on "Fusió de taules"

**1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary:**

The problem asks for a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted.

Your `fusio` function implements the classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements at the current pointers (`i1` for `v1`, `i2` for `v2`). The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva` list, and its corresponding pointer is incremented. This continues until one of the lists is exhausted. Finally, any remaining elements from the non-exhausted list are appended to the `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge logic. It handles duplicates by appending them in their natural sorted order, and efficiently appends remaining elements.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm has a linear time complexity, O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for merging sorted lists.
    *   **Readability (function `fusio`):** The `fusio` function is clear and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Adherence to Problem Specification:** The primary weakness, and the likely cause of the "Presentation Error," is the inclusion of the `main` function and the `llegir_dades` helper function, which perform input/output. The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means "Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored."
    *   **Extraneous Output:** Your `main` function generates output (`n1+n2` and then the merged list elements). Since the judging system is only interested in calling the `fusio` function directly and processing its return value, any output generated by *your* `main` function is considered incorrect output, leading to a "Presentation Error."

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Extraneous Code:** The most crucial step to resolve the "Presentation Error" is to remove all code outside of the `fusio` function definition. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]: ...`
    *   `def main(): ...`
    *   `main()`
    Your submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function.

2.  **Careful Reading of Instructions:** Always pay close attention to problem statements and submission guidelines, especially phrases that indicate what code should or should not be included (e.g., "only the requested procedure," "main program will be ignored"). This is a very common source of "Presentation Errors" in online judges.

**In summary:** Your `fusio` function is excellent and correctly solves the problem. The issue is with the structure of your submission, including a `main` function that produces output when the judge expects only the `fusio` function. Removing the `main` program and its related input/output code should make your solution pass.
