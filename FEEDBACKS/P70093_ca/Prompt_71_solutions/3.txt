### Feedback: Fusió de taules (Merging Sorted Lists)

**Problem Summary:**
The task is to implement a function, `fusio`, that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single sorted list. Duplicate elements should be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem statement specifies that only the `fusio` procedure is to be submitted, and the main program will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function correctly implements a standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes an empty list `llista_definitiva` and uses two index pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to iterate through `v1` and `v2` respectively. In each step, it compares the elements at the current pointers and appends the smaller one to `llista_definitiva`, incrementing the corresponding pointer. Once one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends the remaining elements of the other list using `extend`.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge logic for two sorted lists, preserving order and duplicates. This approach is highly efficient with a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists.
    *   **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are descriptive, making the code easy to understand.
    *   **Modularity:** The solution is structured with a dedicated function (`fusio`) for the core logic, adhering to the problem's request for a specific procedure. The auxiliary `llegir_dades` function and `main` block are also logically separated.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Presentation Error in `main` function Output:** The "Presentation Error" indicates that the output format generated by your `main` function does not precisely match the expected format.
        *   The line `print(n1+n2)` prints the total number of elements, which is not requested by the problem statement. The problem only asks to "return the result" (the merged list itself).
        *   The line `print(" ",end="")` adds an extra space before printing the merged list, which is likely not expected and contributes to the presentation error.
    *   **Non-compliant `main` function:** While the `fusio` function is excellent, the problem explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means the `llegir_dades` and `main` functions are not required for submission and would be disregarded by the automated judge. The `Presentation Error` refers to the output generated by *your entire program*, even if parts are technically ignored.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output in `main` (for local testing):** To avoid "Presentation Error" if the `main` function were to be evaluated (or for correct local testing output), modify the `main` function to only print the merged list in the standard format (elements separated by spaces, followed by a newline).
    ```python
    def main():
        n1 = read(int)
        v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
        n2 = read(int)
        v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
        # Remove these lines:
        # print(n1+n2)
        # print(" ",end="")
        print(*fusio(v1,v2))
    ```
2.  **Adhere to Submission Guidelines:** For the actual submission, ensure you *only* include the `fusio` function as specified by the "Observació". The `yogi` import, `llegir_dades` function, and the `main` block are not part of the required submission.

**Conclusion:**
Your `fusio` function is a well-implemented and efficient solution to the merging problem. The "Presentation Error" is solely due to extraneous output from your `main` function, which should either be corrected for local testing or, more importantly, omitted entirely for submission according to the problem's instructions.
