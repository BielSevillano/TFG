### Feedback for Fusió de taules

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (or vectors) of numbers, `v1` and `v2`, into a single, combined sorted list. The result should include all elements from both input lists, preserving duplicates. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should yield `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your solution approaches this problem using the classic **two-pointer merge algorithm**. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of each input list. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to a new result list (`llista_definitiva`) and advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended to the result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The core `fusio` function correctly implements the merging logic as described. It adheres to the problem's requirements of maintaining sorted order and preserving duplicates.
    *   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer merge algorithm is highly efficient, with a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. This is optimal for merging already sorted lists.
    *   **Readability:** The `fusio` function is well-structured, easy to read, and uses descriptive variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).
    *   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`list[float]`) enhances code clarity and maintainability.
    *   **Robustness:** The `fusio` function correctly handles edge cases, such as one or both input lists being empty, without requiring special explicit checks.

*   **Weaknesses and Cause of "Presentation Error":**
    *   **Misinterpretation of "Observació":** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is likely due to the "Observació" (observation) section in the problem statement, which says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.)
    *   Your submitted code includes a `main()` function, a `llegir_dades` helper function, and input/output operations (`from yogi import read`, `read(int)`, `print(...)`). The judge system expects *only* the `fusio` function definition. The additional `print` statements in your `main` function (e.g., `print(n1+n2)` and `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`) produce output that is not expected by the judge, leading to a "Presentation Error." The judge's test harness will call your `fusio` function directly with test data and then compare its return value, not analyze the output of your `main` function.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove `main` function and I/O code for submission:** To resolve the "Presentation Error," you must **remove all code outside of the `fusio` function**. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:` and its implementation
    *   `def main():` and its entire implementation
    *   `main()`
    The submitted file should contain *only* the definition of the `fusio` function.

```python
# The submitted code should look like this:
def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
    i1 = 0
    i2 = 0
    llista_definitiva=[]
    while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
        if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
            llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
            i1 += 1
        else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], ensuring duplicates from v2 are added first if equal
            llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
            i2 += 1
    llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:]) # Append remaining elements from v1
    llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:]) # Append remaining elements from v2
    return llista_definitiva
```

By making this change, your excellent `fusio` implementation should pass the tests.
