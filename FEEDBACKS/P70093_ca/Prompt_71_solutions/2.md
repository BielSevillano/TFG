## Feedback for the `fusio` function

This code implements a function `fusio` that merges two sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) into a single sorted list, without removing duplicate elements. The problem statement is clear: given two pre-sorted lists, produce a new list that contains all elements from both, also sorted.

### Solution Approach

The provided solution uses an iterative approach. It maintains two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to track the current element being considered in `v1` and `v2` respectively. It iterates as long as there are elements in both lists. In each iteration, it compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2` and appends the smaller element to the result list `R`. The corresponding pointer is then incremented. After one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are appended to `R`.

### Code Strengths:

*   **Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements the merge operation for sorted lists. It handles all cases, including when one list is exhausted before the other.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for merging two sorted lists as each element is examined and appended exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n + m) due to the creation of the new result list.
*   **Readability:** The code is generally well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names like `v1`, `v2`, `i1`, `i2`, and `R` are intuitive for this type of algorithm.
*   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`list[float]`) improves code clarity and allows for static analysis.

### Code Weaknesses:

*   **No Error Handling for Unsorted Input:** The problem statement specifies that the input lists `v1` and `v2` are pre-sorted. However, the code does not include any checks to verify this pre-condition. If unsorted lists were provided, the output would not be correctly sorted. While this adheres to the "Precondició" in the problem description, in a real-world scenario, it might be beneficial to add such checks or at least document this assumption very clearly.
*   **Minor Readability Improvement for Remaining Elements:** The lines `R.extend(v1[i1:])` and `R.extend(v2[i2:])` are efficient and correct. However, for someone less familiar with Python slicing, a small explicit `while` loop to append the remaining elements might be slightly more illustrative, though less concise.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1.  **Pre-condition Check (Optional but Recommended for Robustness):**
    While not strictly required by the problem statement, for increased robustness, you could add assertions or checks to ensure that `v1` and `v2` are indeed sorted. This would look like:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        # Optional: Pre-condition check for sorted input
        if not all(v1[i] <= v1[i+1] for i in range(len(v1)-1)):
            raise ValueError("Input list v1 is not sorted.")
        if not all(v2[i] <= v2[i+1] for i in range(len(v2)-1)):
            raise ValueError("Input list v2 is not sorted.")

        n1, n2 = len(v1), len(v2)
        i1, i2 = 0, 0
        R: list[float] = []
        while i1 < n1 and i2 < n2:
            if v1[i1] <= v2[i2]:
                R.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                R.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        R.extend(v1[i1:])
        R.extend(v2[i2:])
        return R
    ```
    However, given the context of a programming judge, sticking to the provided interface and pre-conditions is usually the correct approach.

2.  **Docstrings:**
    While the type hints are good, adding a more comprehensive docstring explaining what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns would be beneficial for any public-facing function. For example:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        """
        Merges two sorted lists of floats into a single sorted list.

        Args:
            v1: The first sorted list of floats.
            v2: The second sorted list of floats.

        Returns:
            A new sorted list containing all elements from v1 and v2.
            Duplicate elements are preserved.

        Precondition:
            v1 and v2 must be sorted in ascending order.
        """
        # ... rest of the code
    ```

### Conclusion:

The provided `fusio` function is a well-implemented and efficient solution to the problem. It adheres to the specified requirements and is easy to understand. The minor suggestions for improvement are more about general code quality and robustness rather than fixing any functional issues. The solution is appropriate for the given problem description.
