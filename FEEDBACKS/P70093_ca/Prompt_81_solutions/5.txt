### Feedback for the "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) `v1` and `v2` into a single new sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The submitted Python program correctly implements this merge logic within the `fusio` function using a two-pointer approach, often referred to as the "merge" step of merge sort. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at the current pointers (`i1` for `v1` and `i2` for `v2`). The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva` (final list), and its corresponding pointer is incremented. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are simply extended to the `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Merge Logic:** The `fusio` function's algorithm is a standard and efficient way to merge two sorted lists. It correctly handles duplicates and maintains the sorted order.
2.  **Time Complexity:** The `fusio` function operates in O(N + M) time, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively, which is optimal for this problem.
3.  **Clarity:** Variable names like `llista_definitiva`, `i1`, and `i2` are descriptive and make the merge logic easy to follow.
4.  **Type Hints:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float] -> list[float]`) is excellent practice for code readability and maintainability.

**Code Weaknesses and Cause of "Presentation Error":**

1.  **Violation of Problem Interface:** The core weakness, and the likely cause of the "Presentation Error", is the presence and execution of the `main` function and associated input/output logic (`read`, `print`). The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) This means the judge system expects *only* the `fusio` function definition. Any output generated by a `main` function (like printing `n1+n2` or the elements of the merged list with a leading space) will be considered incorrect output formatting, leading to a "Presentation Error".
2.  **Unnecessary Input/Output for the Function:** The `fusio` function itself is designed to *return* a list, not print it. The `main` function's role in reading input and printing output is outside the scope of what was asked for the submission.
3.  **Dependency on `yogi` library:** The `main` function uses `from yogi import read`. While common in some competitive programming environments, if only the function is to be submitted, external libraries for I/O should not be included or assumed to be present for the function itself.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the `main` function and all associated input/output code.** The submitted solution should consist solely of the `fusio` function definition as per the problem's instructions.
    *   Specifically, delete the lines:
        ```python
        from yogi import read
        def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:
            # ...
        def main():
            # ...
        main()
        ```
    *   The submission should look like this:
        ```python
        def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
            i1 = 0
            i2 = 0
            llista_definitiva=[]
            while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
                if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                    i1 += 1
                else:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                    i2 += 1
            llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
            llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
            return llista_definitiva
        ```
2.  **Add a Docstring to the `fusio` function:** While not strictly required by the problem, a docstring would improve the function's documentation, explaining what it does, its parameters, and what it returns.

By making these changes, the code will adhere to the problem's interface requirements and should pass the "Presentation Error". The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented.
