### Feedback for 'Fusió de taules' Program

**1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary**

The problem requires merging two pre-sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single, combined sorted list. Crucially, duplicate elements must be preserved. The solution employs the classic two-pointer merge algorithm: it iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements at the current pointers and appending the smaller element to a new result list. Once one of the input lists is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are simply appended to the result.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm (`fusio` function):** The core `fusio` function correctly implements the efficient two-pointer merge algorithm. This approach has a time complexity of O(N1 + N2), where N1 and N2 are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively, which is optimal for merging sorted lists.
*   **Clear and Readable Logic:** The `fusio` function's logic is easy to follow, with descriptive variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).
*   **Efficient Remaining Append:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is a Pythonic and efficient way to append the remaining elements after one list is exhausted.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Presentation Error (Output Format and Problem Constraints):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is likely due to how the program interacts with the judging system.
    *   **"Observació" Misinterpretation:** The problem statement clearly says, "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means only the `fusio` function should be submitted, and any `main` function or I/O handling will be ignored or cause errors. Your `main` function includes input reading and prints additional information (`n1+n2` and a leading space) that is not expected.
    *   **Unnecessary Output:** The `print(n1+n2)` statement and the `print(" ",end="")` create output that the problem does not request, leading to the format mismatch. The problem usually expects just the result of the function call to be printed, in a specific format (typically space-separated values).
*   **Type Hint Inconsistency (`llegir_dades`):** The `llegir_dades` function's return type hint is `list[int]`, but it reads `float` values. While Python is dynamically typed and this doesn't cause a runtime error, it's an inconsistency in the type annotations.
*   **Redundant Code:** The `from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, and `main` functions are not required for submission based on the problem's observation.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Crucial: Remove `main` function and I/O logic for submission.** Adhere strictly to the "Observació" in the problem statement. Submit *only* the `fusio` function. This is the most critical change to resolve the "Presentation Error".
    ```python
    # This is likely the only part you need to submit
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Covers v1[i1] >= v2[i2], correctly handling duplicates by taking v2[i2] first
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Correct Type Hint in `llegir_dades` (if kept locally):** If you were to keep `llegir_dades` for local testing, update its type hint for consistency:
    ```python
    def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]: # Changed list[int] to list[float]
        L = []
        for i in range(n):
            x = read(float)
            L.append(x)
        return L
    ```

Your `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correctly solves the merging logic. The issues stem from the surrounding program structure and output.
