### Feedback for 'Fusió de taules' Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function, `fusio`, that takes two already sorted lists of numbers (`v1` and `v2`) as input. The function's goal is to merge these two lists into a single new list, which must also be sorted. A key requirement is to retain all duplicate elements from both original lists. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem statement explicitly mentions that only the requested function should be submitted, and any main program will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python code implements the classic two-pointer merge algorithm within the `fusio` function. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of `v1` and `v2`, respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller one to `llista_definitiva` and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm. It efficiently handles the comparison and appending of elements, as well as correctly appends any remaining elements from either list once one of them is fully processed. This ensures the resulting list is sorted and contains all elements, including duplicates.
*   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(m + n) time complexity, where 'm' and 'n' are the lengths of the input lists. This is an optimal solution for merging two sorted lists.
*   **Readability:** The `fusio` function is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).
*   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `-> list[float]`) is good practice, improving code clarity and maintainability.

**Code Weaknesses and Reason for "Presentation Error":**
*   **Violation of Submission Instructions:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is the inclusion of the `main` function and its associated input/output logic (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, `print` statements). The problem description explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored). This means any output produced by the `main` function is unexpected by the automated judge, leading to a Presentation Error.
*   **Extraneous Code:** The `llegir_dades` function, while functional, is also unnecessary for the submission, as only the `fusio` function is being evaluated.
*   **Output Format (if `main` were relevant):** Even if a `main` function were expected, the specific output format `print(n1+n2)` followed by `print(" ",end="")` and `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` is unconventional. Typically, only the merged list elements (space-separated) would be expected, without additional information like the total length.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Remove Extraneous Code (Critical):** To resolve the "Presentation Error," remove the entire `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and the `from yogi import read` statement. The submission should *only* contain the `fusio` function definition.
2.  **Local Variable Naming (Minor):** In the `fusio` function, `llista_definitiva` is descriptive. For a slightly more universally understood name in English contexts, `merged_list` or `result_list` could be considered, but `llista_definitiva` is perfectly acceptable.

Overall, your `fusio` function is very well implemented, efficient, and correct for the task. The error lies solely in including the testing/driver code in the final submission, against the explicit instructions.
