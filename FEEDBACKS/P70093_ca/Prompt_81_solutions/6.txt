### Feedback on "Fusió de taules"

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem requires implementing a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of numbers (floats in the Python interface) and merges them into a single sorted list, preserving any duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python program approaches this by implementing the `fusio` function using a standard two-pointer (or merge) algorithm:
*   It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of `v1` and `v2`, respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` for the result.
*   It iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`. The smaller element is appended to `llista_definitiva`, and its respective pointer is incremented.
*   Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are simply appended to `llista_definitiva`.
*   Finally, `llista_definitiva` is returned.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct `fusio` implementation:** The core `fusio` function correctly implements the specified merge logic. It correctly handles duplicates and efficiently combines the two sorted lists.
*   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach is optimal for this problem, having a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively.
*   **Readability:** Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are clear and descriptive. The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `-> list[float]`) further improves code readability and maintainability.
*   **Pythonic approach:** Using `extend` to add the remaining elements of a list is a Pythonic and efficient way to handle that part of the merge.

**Weaknesses (leading to "Presentation Error"):**

*   **Violation of submission requirements:** The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.)
    *   The submission includes a `main` function and a `llegir_dades` helper function, which contain input reading (`read` from `yogi`) and output printing logic.
    *   The "Presentation Error" indicates that the output produced by your `main` function does not precisely match the expected format (or, in this case, any output at all for the main program section). Specifically, printing `n1+n2` and a leading space (`print(" ", end="")`) are not expected outputs for this problem.
*   **Unnecessary import:** The `from yogi import read` statement is only used by the `llegir_dades` and `main` functions, not by the `fusio` function itself. If only `fusio` is submitted, this import is not needed.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To fix the "Presentation Error" and adhere to the problem's requirements:

1.  **Remove all auxiliary code:** Delete the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and the `from yogi import read` statement.
2.  **Submit only the `fusio` function:** Your submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function, as specified by the problem.

**Corrected minimal submission:**

```python
def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
    i1 = 0
    i2 = 0
    llista_definitiva = []
    while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
        if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
            llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
            i1 += 1
        else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], ensuring duplicates from v2 are added
            llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
            i2 += 1
    llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
    llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
    return llista_definitiva
```

By making these changes, your solution will correctly implement the requested function and meet the strict submission and output requirements of the platform. The logic within your `fusio` function is already excellent!
