This feedback concerns your Python program for the "Fusió de taules" problem.

### Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

The problem asks for a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single, new sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your solution correctly employs the standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at the current pointers and appending the smaller one to a new result list. Pointers are advanced accordingly. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended to the result.

### Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

1.  **Correct `fusio` Implementation:** The `fusio` function itself is a well-implemented and efficient solution for merging two sorted lists. It correctly handles:
    *   Comparing elements and appending the smaller one.
    *   Preserving duplicate elements (e.g., if `v1[i1] == v2[i2]`, `v2[i2]` is appended first, and then `v1[i1]` will be considered in the next iteration).
    *   Appending remaining elements from either `v1` or `v2` after one list is fully processed, using Python's convenient slicing and `extend` method.
2.  **Time Complexity:** The `fusio` function operates in O(N + M) time, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for this problem, as every element must be visited once.
3.  **Clarity:** The logic within `fusio` is straightforward and easy to understand.

**Weaknesses:**

1.  **Presentation Error (Main Issue):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that your submission includes a `main` function and associated input/output operations (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, `print`). The problem statement explicitly states in the "Observació":
    > "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat."
    > (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.)
    This means the judge expects *only* the `fusio` function definition in your submission file, without any code for reading input or printing output. Including a `main` function or I/O will result in a "Presentation Error" because the output (or even the presence of I/O) does not match the expected submission format.
2.  **Unnecessary `main` output:** Even if a `main` were allowed, your current `main` prints `n1+n2` and then ` " " ` before the merged list, which is not part of the problem's expected output format for the merged list.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Remove Non-Function Code (Critical):** To resolve the "Presentation Error," you *must* remove everything from your submission except the `fusio` function definition. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]: ...`
    *   `def main(): ...`
    *   `main()`
    Your submission file should look like this:
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Read Problem Statements Carefully:** Always pay close attention to sections like "Interfície" and "Observació" as they contain crucial details about how to submit your solution and what kind of code is expected.
3.  **Variable Naming (Minor):** While `llista_definitiva` is descriptive, `result` or `merged_list` could be slightly more concise for a local variable. This is a style preference and doesn't affect correctness.

Once these changes are made, your `fusio` function should pass the tests correctly.
