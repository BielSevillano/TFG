### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function named `fusio` that takes two pre-sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers. The function's goal is to merge these two lists into a single, new sorted list, ensuring that all elements from both input lists are present and duplicates are preserved. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should yield `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem explicitly states that only the requested procedure (`fusio` function) should be submitted, and the main program will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python code implements the `fusio` function using a standard two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It initializes two index pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively. It then iteratively compares the elements at these pointers, appending the smaller one to a new list (`llista_definitiva`) and advancing the corresponding pointer. This continues until one of the input lists is exhausted. Finally, any remaining elements from the non-exhausted list are efficiently appended to the `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct `fusio` Implementation:** The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correctly solves the problem. It accurately merges two sorted lists, preserves duplicates, and maintains the sorted order of the final list.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` is highly efficient, running in linear time complexity (O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`). This is optimal for the given problem.
    *   **Readability:** The code within the `fusio` function is clear, concise, and easy to understand, thanks to descriptive variable names and straightforward logic.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Violation of Submission Instructions (Primary Issue):** The most significant weakness, and the likely cause of the "Presentation Error," is the inclusion of the `llegir_dades` and `main` functions, along with their input/output operations. The problem explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) Submitting additional code, especially code that performs I/O, often leads to "Presentation Error" or "Wrong Answer" on automated judging systems because the output format does not match the judge's expectations for only the function's execution.
    *   **Extraneous Output:** If the `main` function were evaluated, it prints `n1+n2` (the total length), which is not requested by the problem. It also adds a leading space before printing the merged list (`print(" ",end="")`), which is a common cause of "Presentation Error" if exact spacing is not specified or required to be absent.
    *   **Type Hint Inconsistency (Minor):** In the `llegir_dades` function, the type hint `->list[int]` is inconsistent with the `read(float)` operation and `list[float]` usage in `fusio`. This is a minor static analysis issue and doesn't affect runtime, but it's good practice to keep type hints accurate. However, as per instructions, this function should be removed.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove All Extraneous Code:** The most critical step is to remove the `from yogi import read` line, the `llegir_dades` function, the `main` function, and the `main()` call. Only the `fusio` function, as defined by the problem interface, should be submitted.

    ```python
    # Ensure no other code or imports are present in the submitted file,
    # except for the fusio function itself.
    
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

By following this suggestion, the "Presentation Error" should be resolved, as the core logic of your `fusio` function is sound and directly addresses the problem's requirements within the specified interface.
