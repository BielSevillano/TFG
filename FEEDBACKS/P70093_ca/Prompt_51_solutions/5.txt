**Feedback for the Python Program**

**Problem Summary:**
The task is to implement a function named `fusio` that merges two pre-sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single sorted list. The function must preserve all duplicate elements present in the input lists.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program implements the `fusio` function using a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two index pointers (`i1` and `i2`) for `v1` and `v2`, respectively, and an empty list (`llista_definitiva`) to store the result. It then iterates while both pointers are within their respective list bounds, comparing the elements at `v1[i1]` and `v2[i2]`. The smaller element is appended to `llista_definitiva`, and its corresponding pointer is advanced. After one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended to `llista_definitiva` using `extend()`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function implements the standard and efficient merge algorithm for two sorted lists. It correctly handles duplicate elements and maintains the sorted order of the merged list.
*   **Optimal Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(N + M) time, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively, which is optimal for merging two sorted lists.
*   **Readability:** The logic within the `fusio` function is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand due to descriptive variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).
*   **Pythonic Practices:** The use of `list.extend()` to append the remaining elements from the input lists is an efficient and idiomatic Python approach.

**Weaknesses and Reason for "Presentation Error":**
*   **Extraneous Code:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is the inclusion of a full program structure beyond the requested `fusio` function. The problem statement explicitly specifies: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Your submission includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   `def llegir_dades(...)`
    *   `def main(): ...`
    This additional code, including input reading and printing, is not expected by the automated grading system and leads to the "Presentation Error" because the output format generated by your `main()` function (`print(n1+n2)`, `print(" ",end="")`, `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`) does not match what the system expects (which is typically just the return value of the `fusio` function being called internally).
*   **Unnecessary I/O for the Function:** The `fusio` function itself should not perform any input or output operations. Its role is purely to take two lists as input and return a new list. The `main()` function's I/O violates this separation of concerns.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Remove All Extraneous Code:** For submission to platforms like Jutge.org, you should **only** submit the `fusio` function as defined in the problem interface. Delete the `from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades` function, and the entire `main()` function block.
2.  **Focus on Function Implementation:** The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correct. No changes are needed within the `fusio` function logic.
3.  **Variable Naming (Minor):** While `llista_definitiva` is perfectly understandable, a slightly more concise name like `merged_list` or `result` could be considered for brevity, but this is a very minor stylistic point and not critical for correctness.

By removing the non-`fusio` related code, your submission should pass the "Presentation Error" and correctly solve the problem.
