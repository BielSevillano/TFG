### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function named `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) as input. The goal is to merge these two lists into a single, combined list that remains sorted in ascending order, without removing any duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

**Solution Approach:**
The submitted Python program implements the `fusio` function using a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to `llista_definitiva` and advancing the corresponding pointer. If elements are equal, it prioritizes appending from `v2` (or `v1`, either choice works for correctness as long as order is maintained). Once one list is exhausted, all remaining elements from the other list are appended to the `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correct Algorithm Implementation:** The `fusio` function accurately implements the standard two-pointer merge algorithm for sorted lists. It correctly handles the merging logic, including duplicates, to produce a single sorted list.
2.  **Efficiency:** The `fusio` function operates with optimal time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. It processes each element from both lists at most once. The space complexity is O(N + M) for the resulting merged list.
3.  **Readability:** The code within the `fusio` function is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are clear and descriptive.
4.  **Type Hinting:** The `fusio` function benefits from type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float] -> list[float]`), which improves code clarity and maintainability.

**Weaknesses:**
1.  **Presentation Error (due to `main` function):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is the inclusion and execution of the `main()` function, along with `llegir_dades()`. The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means the submission system expects *only* the `fusio` function definition. Any other code that produces output (like the `print` statements in your `main` function) will cause a `Presentation Error` because it deviates from the expected output format for testing. Specifically, printing `n1+n2` and a leading space before the merged list elements are extraneous outputs.
2.  **Minor Type Hint Discrepancy in `llegir_dades`:** In the `llegir_dades` function, the return type hint is `list[int]`, while the function correctly reads and appends `float` values using `read(float)`. This is a minor inconsistency in the type annotation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Extraneous Code for Submission:** To resolve the "Presentation Error," you must remove the `main()` function and the `llegir_dades()` helper function from your submitted code. Only the `fusio` function definition should be submitted, as per the problem instructions. The testing system will call your `fusio` function directly with its own input.
2.  **Correct Type Hint (if keeping `llegir_dades` locally):** If you wish to keep `llegir_dades` for local testing, update its type hint to `def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]:` to accurately reflect the type of data it handles.

The `fusio` function itself is excellent and correctly solves the problem. The issue lies solely with the surrounding code generating unexpected output.
