### Feedback for "Fusió de taules"

This feedback addresses your Python program for the "Fusió de taules" problem.

#### 1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach

The problem asks you to implement a function named `fusio` that takes two **already sorted** lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers and merges them into a single new sorted list. An important constraint is that duplicate elements must be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The precondition states that the input lists `v1` and `v2` are always sorted in ascending order.

Your `fusio` function employs the standard **two-pointer merge algorithm**. It initializes two pointers, one for each input list, and an empty list to store the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by the two pointers, appending the smaller one to the result list and advancing its respective pointer. If elements are equal, it appends one of them (your code appends `v2[i2]`) and advances its pointer, correctly preserving duplicates. After one of the input lists is fully traversed, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list to the result.

#### 2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge logic for two sorted lists, including the preservation of duplicate elements, as specified by the problem.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` is highly efficient. It iterates through each element of the input lists once, resulting in a time complexity of O(N1 + N2), where N1 and N2 are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for merging sorted lists.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code for `fusio` is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand, making it maintainable.
*   **Pythonic Implementation:** The use of `append` for adding single elements and `extend` with slicing (`v1[i1:]`, `v2[i2:]`) for adding remaining elements is idiomatic and efficient Python.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Presentation Error (Main Program Output):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is the inclusion of the `main` function which performs input/output operations. The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Online judges like Jutge.org expect only the function implementation for such problems. Any output generated by a `main` function (even if correct for local testing) will typically cause a "Presentation Error" because it doesn't match the expected (non-existent) output of the test driver.
*   **Minor Type Hinting Inconsistency:** In the `llegir_dades` function, the type hint `->list[int]` is technically incorrect, as `x = read(float)` indicates that the list will contain floating-point numbers, not integers. This is a minor point that doesn't affect functionality but is good practice to align.

#### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Remove or Guard the `main` Function for Submission:**
    To resolve the "Presentation Error," you should remove the `main()` function and the `llegir_dades()` function, along with `from yogi import read` and the `main()` call, from your submission. Only the `fusio` function should be present.
    If you wish to keep the `main` function for local testing while still being able to submit, you can guard it using Python's standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        # ... (your fusio function code) ...
        pass # placeholder

    def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]: # Corrected type hint
        # ... (your llegir_dades function code) ...
        pass # placeholder

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        n1 = read(int)
        v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
        n2 = read(int)
        v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
        # Note: The problem asks only for the function, not for specific output from main.
        # This output format is just for your local testing.
        print(n1 + n2)
        print(" ", end="")
        print(*fusio(v1, v2))
    ```

2.  **Correct Type Hint in `llegir_dades`:**
    Change `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:` to `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[float]:` to accurately reflect that the function returns a list of floating-point numbers.

The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and demonstrates a solid understanding of the required algorithm. Good job on that core logic!
