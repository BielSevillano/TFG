The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function `fusio` that merges two pre-sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of numbers into a single sorted list, preserving any duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order. The problem explicitly states that *only the requested procedure needs to be submitted*, and the main program will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program implements the `fusio` function using a standard two-pointer (or two-iterator) merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively. It iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to a new list called `llista_definitiva` and advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended directly to `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm, which is an optimal approach for merging two already sorted lists. It processes each element from both input lists exactly once, resulting in an efficient time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively.
*   **Clear Variable Names:** Variable names like `llista_definitiva`, `i1`, and `i2` are descriptive and enhance code readability.
*   **Concise Remaining Elements Handling:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant and efficient way to append any remaining elements from the input lists after the main `while` loop finishes.
*   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]`) is a good practice for code clarity and maintainability in Python.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Inappropriate Main Program for Submission (Primary Issue):** The main reason for the "Presentation Error" is the inclusion of the `main` function and its associated input/output operations (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, `print` statements, and the `main()` call). The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) This means the submission should *only* contain the `fusio` function, without any code for reading input or printing output. Jutge.org expects only the function definition to be submitted, and it will handle calling the function with test cases and checking its return value.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Remove the Main Program (Critical):** To resolve the "Presentation Error," you must remove everything outside the `fusio` function definition. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   The `llegir_dades` function definition
    *   The `main` function definition
    *   The `main()` call at the end of the script.
    
    The submitted code should strictly be:
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # This covers v1[i1] >= v2[i2], ensuring stability for equal elements
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
    This adheres to the problem's interface and submission requirements, allowing the online judge to test your `fusio` function directly.
