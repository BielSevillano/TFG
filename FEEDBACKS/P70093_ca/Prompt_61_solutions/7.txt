This feedback addresses the Python program provided for the "Fusió de taules" (Table Merge) problem.

### Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

The problem asks for a function that merges two pre-sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new sorted list, without removing any duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

The provided Python program implements the `fusio` function using a standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`), one for each input list. It then iterates, comparing the elements at the current pointer positions. The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva` (definitive list), and its respective pointer is advanced. This continues until one of the lists is exhausted. Finally, any remaining elements from the other list are appended to the `llista_definitiva`.

### Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Logic:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm for sorted lists. It effectively combines the elements while maintaining the sorted order and preserving all duplicates, as required.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for merging two sorted lists.
*   **Clear Pointer Usage:** The use of `i1` and `i2` as indices/pointers is clear and standard for this type of problem.
*   **Concise Handling of Remaining Elements:** Using `extend(v1[i1:])` and `extend(v2[i2:])` is a Pythonic and efficient way to append any leftover elements.

**Weaknesses (and cause of "Presentation Error"):**

*   **Violation of Submission Requirements:** The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) The submitted code includes a `main` function, input reading logic (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`), and output printing (`print(n1+n2)`, `print(" ",end="")`, `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`).
*   **Unexpected Output Format:** The "Presentation Error" indicates that the program's output does not exactly match the expected format. This is because the `main` function prints the sum of lengths (`n1+n2`) and then the merged list, which is not expected for a submission that only requires the function itself. The testing system would call your `fusio` function directly with its own inputs and check its return value, not execute your `main` function.

### Suggestions for Improvement

The core `fusio` function is well-implemented and correct for the problem. The main issue is the extraneous code.

1.  **Crucial:** Remove all code outside the `fusio` function definition. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   `def llegir_dades(...)`
    *   `def main(): ...`
    *   The `main()` call at the end of the file.

    Your submission should consist *only* of the `def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:` block and its contents.

2.  **Minor (Style/Readability):**
    *   Consider a slightly more concise name for `llista_definitiva`, such as `merged_list` or `result`. This is a minor point and `llista_definitiva` is understandable.

By removing the unnecessary input/output and `main` function, your solution will conform to the problem's submission requirements and should pass the "Presentation Error".
