**Feedback for Program: Fusió de taules**

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" (Table Merge) requires implementing a function that merges two given sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) into a single, combined sorted list. The crucial constraint is that duplicate elements must be preserved in the resulting merged list. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should yield `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists `v1` and `v2` are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order. The problem explicitly states that only the requested function (`fusio`) should be submitted, and any main program or auxiliary code will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The program implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm within the `fusio` function. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to track the current position in `v1` and `v2`, respectively, and an empty list (`llista_definitiva`) to store the merged result. It iteratively compares the elements at the current pointers of `v1` and `v2`, appending the smaller element to `llista_definitiva` and advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one of the input lists is fully processed, the remaining elements of the other list are appended directly to `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The `fusio` function accurately implements the two-pointer merge algorithm. It correctly handles various scenarios, including empty lists, lists of different lengths, and the preservation of duplicate elements, resulting in a perfectly sorted merged list. This approach is standard and highly reliable for merging sorted sequences.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` is highly efficient, with a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal as every element from both input lists must be visited at least once.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The `fusio` function is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names (e.g., `llista_definitiva` – "final list" in Catalan), making the logic easy to follow.
*   **Pythonic `extend`:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` to append remaining elements is a concise and efficient Python idiom.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Violation of Submission Guidelines (Critical):** The primary weakness and the most probable cause of the "Presentation Error" is the inclusion and execution of the `main` function and its associated input/output logic (`read`, `llegir_dades`, `print`). The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means the submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function definition. Any output generated by `main()` for local testing will be considered unexpected by the automated grading system.
*   **Unnecessary Output in `main`:** Even if a `main` function were allowed, printing `n1+n2` and an additional space (`print(" ",end="")`) before the merged list is not part of the problem's output specification and would contribute to a presentation error.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adhere to Submission Requirements (Mandatory):** For submission to platforms like Jutge.org, it is crucial to strictly follow the "Observació" and submit *only* the requested function. You should remove or comment out the `from yogi import read` line, the `llegir_dades` function, and the entire `main()` function and its call before submitting. The submitted file should ideally contain only the `def fusio(...)` block.

    ```python
    # REMOVE THIS LINE: from yogi import read 

    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], picking v2's element first in case of tie.
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        
        # Append remaining elements from either list
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        
        return llista_definitiva

    # REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT ALL CODE BELOW THIS LINE FOR SUBMISSION:
    # def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:
    #     """Llegeix tots els nombres i els afegeix a la llista"""
    #     L = []
    #     for i in range(n):
    #         x = read(float)
    #         L.append(x)
    #     return L
    #
    # def main():
    #     n1 = read(int)
    #     v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
    #     n2 = read(int)
    #     v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
    #     print(n1+n2)
    #     print(" ",end="")
    #     print(*fusio(v1,v2))
    # main()
    ```

By making this crucial change, the "Presentation Error" should be resolved, and the solution, being functionally correct, should pass the tests.
