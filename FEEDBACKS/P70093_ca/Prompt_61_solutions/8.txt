### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" asks to implement a function that merges two given sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new sorted list, ensuring that duplicate elements are preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem statement specifies the function signature for Python as `fusio(v1, v2)` returning a list, and emphasizes that only the requested procedure should be submitted, ignoring the main program.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function in your submission correctly implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1`, `i2`) to the beginning of `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to `llista_definitiva` and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended to `llista_definitiva` using slicing and `extend`.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the specified merge logic. It handles duplicates as required and maintains the sorted order of elements.
    *   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach provides an optimal time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively, as it processes each element from both lists exactly once. The space complexity is O(n + m) for the new list.
    *   **Readability:** The code within the `fusio` function is clear and easy to understand, following a standard merging pattern.
    *   **Robustness:** The use of `extend` with slices `v1[i1:]` and `v2[i2:]` elegantly handles cases where one or both input lists might be empty, or when one list is fully processed before the other.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Non-compliance with Submission Requirements (Likely Cause of "Presentation Error"):** The most significant issue, and the probable cause of the "Presentation Error", is the inclusion of the `main` function, `llegir_dades` function, and the `from yogi import read` import. The problem statement explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means the judging system expects *only* the `fusio` function definition. When a judge receives extra code like a `main` function that performs I/O, it can lead to a "Presentation Error" if its output format (or even its mere existence) doesn't align with the judge's hidden test harness.
    *   **Irrelevant Reference Solutions:** It's worth noting that the "other possible solutions" provided are for a completely different problem (finding most frequent words). This can be confusing and might have led to misinterpretations if relied upon during development. However, your solution correctly addresses the stated problem "Fusió de taules".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Crucial: Remove Unnecessary Code for Submission:**
    *   Delete the entire `main()` function.
    *   Delete the `llegir_dades()` function.
    *   Remove `from yogi import read`.
    *   The submission should strictly contain only the definition of the `fusio` function, as specified by the "Observació". This is highly likely to resolve the "Presentation Error".

2.  **Minor/Stylistic (Optional):**
    *   The variable `llista_definitiva` (meaning "definitive list") is descriptive. For a broader audience, an English name like `merged_list` or `result_list` could be considered, but it's perfectly acceptable as is.

Your `fusio` function is well-implemented and efficient for the problem it solves. The "Presentation Error" is almost certainly due to the surrounding code that reads input and prints output, which was explicitly stated to be ignored.
