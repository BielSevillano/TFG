The program addresses the "Fusió de taules" problem, which requires merging two pre-sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new sorted list, ensuring that all duplicate elements are preserved. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

### Analysis of the Solution

**1. Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively. It iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to a new list (`llista_definitiva`) and advancing its corresponding pointer. If elements are equal, it prioritizes appending the element from `v2` (but either choice maintains correctness). After one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list using `extend`.

**2. Code Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge logic for two sorted lists, preserving the sorted order and all duplicate elements as required. This is a fundamental and efficient approach for this problem.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm runs in linear time, O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`, respectively. This is optimal as every element from both input lists must be processed once.
*   **Robustness:** It correctly handles cases where one list is empty, or where elements are identical, or where one list is a sub-sequence of the other.
*   **Readability:** The code for the `fusio` function is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are appropriate.

**3. Code Weaknesses and Reason for "Presentation Error":**
The core `fusio` function is excellent. However, the "Presentation Error" arises from elements outside this function:
*   **Violation of Problem Specification:** The problem explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Your submission includes a `main()` function with input reading (`read` from `yogi`) and output printing (`print`). The online judge expects only the `fusio` function to be present in the submission.
*   **Incorrect Output Format in `main`:** Even if a `main` function were allowed, the output produced by your `main` function is not standard for this type of problem. It prints `n1+n2` (the total number of elements) and an additional space `print(" ",end="")` before printing the merged list. This extra output and formatting deviation will cause a "Presentation Error" because the judge expects a very specific output (likely just the elements of the merged list, or no output at all from the submitted code).
*   **Minor Type Hint Issue:** In the `llegir_dades` function (which should be removed), the return type hint `list[int]` is technically incorrect as it reads `float` values. This would not cause a runtime error but is a good practice point.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1.  **Remove the `main` function and all I/O logic:** This is the most critical step. Your submission should *only* contain the definition of the `fusio` function. All `read` and `print` statements, along with `llegir_dades` and `main()`, should be removed. The online judge will call your `fusio` function with test cases directly.

    ```python
    # This is what your submission should look like:
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

2.  **Add a Docstring to `fusio` (Good Practice):** While not required by the judge, adding a docstring to your function is good practice for explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value.

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        """
        Merges two sorted lists of floats into a single sorted list, preserving duplicates.

        Preconditions:
        - v1 and v2 are sorted in ascending order.

        Args:
            v1 (list[float]): The first sorted list.
            v2 (list[float]): The second sorted list.

        Returns:
            list[float]: A new list containing all elements from v1 and v2, sorted
                          in ascending order with duplicates preserved.
        """
        # ... (rest of your excellent fusio function code)
    ```
