### Feedback for 'Fusió de taules' Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks to implement a function that merges two already sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single sorted list. The merged list should retain all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem statement emphasizes that only the requested function should be submitted, and the main program will be ignored.

The provided Python program implements a `fusio` function that correctly addresses this problem using a standard two-pointer approach. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements and appending the smaller one to a new result list. Once one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function's core logic correctly implements the merge operation for two sorted lists. The two-pointer approach (using `i1` and `i2`) is highly efficient, performing the merge in linear time (O(N+M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists).
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are descriptive, making the `fusio` function easy to understand.
*   **Efficiency for Merging:** The use of `extend` for appending remaining elements is an efficient Pythonic way to handle the tail ends of the lists.

**Weaknesses & Reason for "Presentation Error":**

The "Presentation Error" is not due to an incorrect merging algorithm but rather an issue with the program's overall structure and output format, as per the problem's specific submission guidelines.

*   **Problem Misinterpretation (Main Program):** The problem explicitly states, "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) The submitted code includes a `main` function, `llegir_dades` function, and `yogi` imports, which are outside the scope of the `fusio` function itself.
*   **Incorrect Output Format:** The `main` function prints additional information that is not requested:
    *   `print(n1+n2)`: Prints the sum of the lengths of the input lists. This is extraneous.
    *   `print(" ",end="")`: Prints a leading space before the merged list, which is typically not desired and causes a presentation error.
    *   Even if only `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` were present, the platform usually expects *only* the return value of the `fusio` function to be considered, without any explicit print statements in the submitted code for the core function. The judge system invokes the `fusio` function directly and processes its return value.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To fix the "Presentation Error" and fully comply with the problem's requirements, the following steps are crucial:

*   **Remove all extraneous code:** Delete the `from yogi import read` import, the `llegir_dades` function, and the `main` function along with its invocation (`main()`). The submitted file should contain *only* the `fusio` function definition.

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
    This minimal submission will allow the judge system to call your `fusio` function directly and evaluate its return value against the expected output, without interference from your own input/output handling.

By making these changes, your solution will correctly pass the problem, as the `fusio` function itself is a well-implemented and efficient solution to the merge problem.
