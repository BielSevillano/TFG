### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks to implement a function `fusio` that merges two pre-sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers into a single sorted list. The merging should preserve all elements, including duplicates. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` for the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to `llista_definitiva` and advancing its corresponding pointer. If elements are equal, it appends the element from `v2` (or `v1`, either is fine) and advances its pointer. After one list is fully processed, the remaining elements of the other list are appended to the result.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The core `fusio` function accurately implements the merge algorithm for two sorted lists. It correctly handles duplicates and maintains the sorted order of the resulting list.
2.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` has a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for merging two sorted lists.
3.  **Readability:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are clear and the logic is easy to follow. The use of `extend` to append remaining elements is Pythonic and efficient.
4.  **Type Hinting:** The function signature `fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]` correctly uses type hints, improving code clarity and maintainability.

**Weaknesses:**
1.  **Violation of Submission Guidelines (Main Cause of "Presentation Error"):** The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) The provided code includes `llegir_dades`, `main`, and `print` statements that generate output. This extra output (`n1+n2` and the leading space ` " "`) is not expected by the judging system, leading to a "Presentation Error".
2.  **Unnecessary `yogi` import:** The `from yogi import read` import and its usage are part of the main program logic, which should not be submitted.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the `main` Function and Auxiliary Code:** The most crucial step is to delete everything outside the `fusio` function (i.e., `llegir_dades`, `main`, and the `yogi` import). The submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function. This will resolve the "Presentation Error".
    
    *Example of how the submission should look:*
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

2.  **Consider Renaming Variables (Optional):** While current names are clear, using more universally understood English names (e.g., `merged_list` instead of `llista_definitiva`) could make the code more accessible, although given the Catalan context of the problem, the current names are perfectly fine.

The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correct for the problem described. The issue is purely with the surrounding program structure and output.
