### Feedback on "Fusió de taules"

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks to implement a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (vectors/arrays) of numbers into a single, combined sorted list. The crucial requirement is to retain all duplicate elements from both input lists. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

The `fusio` function provided employs a classic and efficient two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`), one for each input list (`v1` and `v2`), and an empty list (`llista_definitiva`) to store the merged result. It iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to `llista_definitiva` and advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are simply appended to `llista_definitiva`. This approach correctly maintains the sorted order and includes all elements as required.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The core `fusio` function is perfectly implemented. It correctly handles element comparisons, appends elements in sorted order, and efficiently deals with the remaining elements of either list after one is fully processed. This is an optimal O(N+M) solution (where N and M are the lengths of the input lists).
    *   **Clarity and Readability:** The code within `fusio` is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand due to descriptive variable names (`llista_definitiva`, `i1`, `i2`) and straightforward logic.
    *   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach is the most efficient way to merge two already sorted lists.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **"Presentation Error" Root Cause:** The primary issue leading to the "Presentation Error" is likely the inclusion of the `main` program and its associated input/output logic (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, `main` function calls, `print` statements). The problem statement explicitly mentions: *"Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat."* (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) This means that for submission to platforms like Jutge.org, only the `fusio` function itself (and any direct helper functions it calls, if any) should be present in the file.
        The `main` function, if executed, would produce output (`n1+n2` and a leading space before the merged list) that is not part of the expected output format for a function-only submission, hence the "Presentation Error".
    *   **Inconsistent Type Hinting (Minor):** In the `llegir_dades` function, the return type hint is `list[int]`, but the function reads `float` values (`x = read(float)`). This is a minor inconsistency; it should ideally be `list[float]` to accurately reflect the data type.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Strictly Adhere to Submission Guidelines:** The most critical improvement is to remove all code related to input reading and the `main` program. **Submit only the `fusio` function** as requested by the problem statement. This will directly address and resolve the "Presentation Error".
    *   Delete: `from yogi import read`
    *   Delete: `def llegir_dades(...)`
    *   Delete: `def main(): ... main()`
    *   Your submitted file should contain only:
        ```python
        def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
            i1 = 0
            i2 = 0
            llista_definitiva=[]
            while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
                if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                    i1 += 1
                else:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                    i2 += 1
            llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
            llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
            return llista_definitiva
        ```

2.  **Correct Type Hinting:** If for some reason `llegir_dades` were to be kept (e.g., for local testing), ensure its type hint is accurate: change `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:` to `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[float]:`.

The core logic of your `fusio` function is excellent and correctly solves the problem. The issues lie solely in the surrounding code that should not be part of the submission for this type of problem.
