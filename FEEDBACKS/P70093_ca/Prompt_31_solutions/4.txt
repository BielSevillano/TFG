### Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks you to implement a function, `fusio`, that takes two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers and merges them into a single sorted list. A key requirement is to **preserve all duplicate elements**. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

Your `fusio` function implements the classic **two-pointer merge algorithm**. It uses two indices (`i1` and `i2`) to iterate through `v1` and `v2` simultaneously. At each step, it compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2` and appends the smaller (or equal) element to a new `llista_definitiva` (the result list), advancing the corresponding pointer. After one of the input lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are simply appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The `fusio` function itself is impeccably implemented. It correctly handles the merging of two sorted lists, maintains the sorted order, and accurately preserves all duplicate elements, exactly as specified in the problem description. This is an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(N+M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`.
    *   **Clarity and Readability:** The `fusio` function's logic is clear, easy to understand, and uses descriptive variable names (`llista_definitiva`, `i1`, `i2`).
    *   **Pythonic `extend`:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant and efficient way to append any remaining elements after the main `while` loop, avoiding unnecessary individual appends.

*   **Weaknesses / Reason for Presentation Error:**
    *   **Violation of Submission Requirements:** The problem statement includes a crucial observation: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Your submission includes a full program with `main()`, `llegir_dades()`, and `yogi` imports, which performs input reading and prints output.
    *   **Extraneous Output:** The "Presentation Error" likely occurred because your `main` function produces output (`n1+n2`, a leading space, and the merged list) that the judging system did not expect. The system expects only the `fusio` function to be present and callable, with its return value being the primary concern, not any console output from a `main` block. The `print(n1+n2)` and `print(" ",end="")` lines are definite causes of unexpected output formatting.
    *   **Unnecessary Imports:** Since the input/output logic is not required for the submission, the `from yogi import read` line is also unnecessary.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

The core `fusio` function is excellent, so the improvements are purely structural to meet the submission guidelines:

1.  **Remove the `main` Function:** Delete the entire `main()` function block.
2.  **Remove Auxiliary Functions:** Delete the `llegir_dades()` function, as it's only used by `main()`.
3.  **Remove Unused Imports:** Delete `from yogi import read`, as it's no longer needed after removing the I/O code.

Your submitted code should *only* contain the definition of the `fusio` function, like this:

```python
def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
    i1 = 0
    i2 = 0
    llista_definitiva = []
    while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
        if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
            llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
            i1 += 1
        else: # Handles v1[i1] >= v2[i2], correctly placing v2[i2] first if equal
            llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
            i2 += 1
    llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
    llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
    return llista_definitiva
```

By making these changes, your solution will conform to the problem's interface and submission requirements, and your correct `fusio` implementation should pass the tests without a Presentation Error.
