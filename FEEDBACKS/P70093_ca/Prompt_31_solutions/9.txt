### Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem requires implementing a function `fusio` that merges two pre-sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers into a single new list, maintaining the sorted order and preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The submitted Python program implements a standard and efficient **two-pointer (or merge) algorithm**. It initializes two pointers, `i1` and `i2`, to track the current position in `v1` and `v2` respectively. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to a new `llista_definitiva` and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, all remaining elements from the other list are appended to the result.

**2. Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function implements the classic merge algorithm correctly. This approach is optimal for merging sorted lists, having a time complexity of O(N+M) where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`. It correctly handles duplicates and maintains the sorted order as required.
*   **Readability:** The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names (e.g., `llista_definitiva`).
*   **Pythonic Elements:** The use of `extend(v1[i1:])` and `extend(v2[i2:])` to add remaining elements is clean and idiomatic Python.
*   **Type Hinting:** The `fusio` function includes correct type hints (`v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]`), which is good practice for clarity and maintainability.

**Weaknesses / Explanation of "Presentation Error":**

The core `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correct according to the problem description. The "Presentation Error" is almost certainly due to the **inclusion of the `main()` function and its associated input/output logic (`llegir_dades`, `read`, `print`)**.

The problem statement explicitly notes: "@Observació: Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means that the judging system expects *only* the definition of the `fusio` function. Any attempt to read input or print output outside of this function (like in your `main` block) will result in a "Presentation Error" because the judge expects no output or specific output related to its own test harness, not output from a user-supplied `main` function.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Remove the `main()` function and related code:**
    The most crucial improvement to resolve the "Presentation Error" is to remove everything *except* the `fusio` function. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]: ...`
    *   `def main(): ...`
    *   `main()`

    The submitted code should look like this (or just the `fusio` function if `yogi` isn't used by it):

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

2.  **Attention to Problem Statements:** Always pay close attention to observation notes (`Observació`) regarding what parts of the code should be submitted. This is a common pitfall in online judges.

The `fusio` function itself is excellent and requires no algorithmic or logical improvements. The issue is purely with the submission format.
