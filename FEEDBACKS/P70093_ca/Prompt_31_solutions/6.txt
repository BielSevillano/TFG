### Feedback for the "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem statement explicitly indicates that only the requested procedure (the `fusio` function) should be submitted, and the main program will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program implements the `fusio` function using a standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to track the current position in `v1` and `v2`, respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. The core logic iterates while both pointers are within their respective list bounds, comparing the elements at the current pointers and appending the smaller one to `llista_definitiva`, then advancing the corresponding pointer. After one list is fully processed, any remaining elements from the other list are appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge logic for two sorted arrays. It accurately combines the elements while maintaining sorted order and including all duplicates, as required.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` has a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`. This is optimal for merging two already sorted lists, as every element needs to be visited once.
*   **Clarity:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are well-chosen and make the code easy to understand. The use of `extend` for remaining elements is a Pythonic and efficient way to handle that part of the merge.

**Weaknesses and Reason for "Presentation Error":**
The "Presentation Error" encountered by the program is almost certainly due to the presence of code outside the requested `fusio` function that produces unexpected output. The problem statement explicitly forbids this: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat."

Specifically:
1.  **Extraneous `main` function and helpers:** The `main()` function, `llegir_dades()` function, and the `from yogi import read` import are all part of the program's driver code, not the core `fusio` function requested.
2.  **Unexpected `print` statements:**
    *   `print(n1+n2)`: This line prints the total number of elements, which is not part of the expected output for the `fusio` problem.
    *   `print(" ",end="")`: This prints an extra space character before the actual merged list elements, leading to an incorrect output format.
    The judge expects *only* the output of the `fusio` function in a specific format (typically space-separated elements on a single line, or one element per line, but definitely no extra meta-information or leading spaces).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Extraneous Code (Crucial):** To fix the "Presentation Error", you must remove the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades()` function, and the `from yogi import read` statement. Only the `fusio` function definition should remain in the submitted file.
    ```python
    # This is the only part that should be submitted:
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Use `if __name__ == "__main__":` for Local Testing (Good Practice):** If you want to keep the testing code (input reading and printing the result) for local development and debugging without interfering with judge submissions, encapsulate it within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This ensures the code only runs when the script is executed directly.

    ```python
    # For local testing, you would structure it like this:
    # from yogi import read # Keep this line for local testing if 'read' is needed

    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        # ... (your correct fusio implementation) ...
        return llista_definitiva

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # from yogi import read # Put read import here if not globally needed for fusio
        def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:
            # ... (your llegir_dades implementation) ...
            pass # Placeholder
            
        n1 = read(int)
        v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
        n2 = read(int)
        v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
        
        result = fusio(v1, v2)
        # The following line would print the merged list correctly if a print was expected:
        # print(*result) 
    ```
    However, for Jutge.org, simply submitting the `fusio` function alone is sufficient and required.
