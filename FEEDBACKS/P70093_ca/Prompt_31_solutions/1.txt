### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks to implement a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of numbers and merges them into a single sorted list. The key requirement is to preserve all elements, including duplicates. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python code implements the `fusio` function using a classic two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1`, `i2`) for `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list (`llista_definitiva`) to store the result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller one to `llista_definitiva` and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are appended directly to the result.

**Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Merge Logic:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the standard merge algorithm for two sorted lists. It accurately compares elements, appends them in sorted order, and handles the remaining elements once one list is fully processed.
2.  **Handles Duplicates:** The algorithm naturally preserves duplicates, as requested by the problem statement.
3.  **Efficiency:** The time complexity of the `fusio` function is O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for merging two sorted lists. The space complexity is O(N + M) for storing the new merged list.
4.  **Readability:** The code for the `fusio` function is clear and easy to understand, with well-named variables for the pointers and the result list.

**Weaknesses:**

1.  **"Presentation Error" Cause (External Code):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is very likely the inclusion of the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` helper function, and the `from yogi import read` import. The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.). On platforms like Jutge.org, submitting code beyond the specific function signature requested often leads to "Presentation Error" or compilation issues, as the system expects *only* the function definition to test.
2.  **Unnecessary Imports for the Function:** The `from yogi import read` import is used by the `main` and `llegir_dades` functions, but `fusio` itself does not require it. Since `main` and `llegir_dades` should not be submitted, this import should also be removed.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Submit Only the Requested Function:** The most crucial improvement is to remove all code outside of the `fusio` function definition. Your submission should consist solely of:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Covers v1[i1] >= v2[i2], preserving order for equal elements
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
    This is the likely fix for the "Presentation Error".

2.  **Minor Renaming (Optional):** While `llista_definitiva` is understandable, a slightly shorter and more common name like `result` or `merged_list` could be used for the result list. This is purely stylistic and does not affect correctness.

The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correctly solves the problem. The issue lies purely in adhering to the submission guidelines of the platform.
