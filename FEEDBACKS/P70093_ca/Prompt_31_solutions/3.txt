### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks to implement a function that merges two pre-sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of numbers into a single new list, which must also be sorted and include all elements, preserving duplicates.

Your `fusio` function correctly addresses this problem using a standard and efficient **two-pointer (or two-iterator) merge algorithm**. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at the current pointers (`i1` and `i2`). The smaller element is appended to a `llista_definitiva` (final list), and its respective pointer is advanced. Once one of the input lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are simply appended to the `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Analysis of Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Logic:** The `fusio` function's implementation of the merge algorithm is perfectly correct. It accurately combines two sorted lists while maintaining the sorted order and preserving all duplicates, as required.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm runs in linear time complexity, O(len(v1) + len(v2)), which is optimal for this problem since every element must be visited at least once.
*   **Readability:** Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are clear and descriptive, enhancing code readability.
*   **Handling Remaining Elements:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant and correct way to handle any elements remaining in either list after the main `while` loop finishes.
*   **Type Hinting:** The `fusio` function includes type hints (`v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]`), which is good practice for code clarity and maintainability.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Presentation Error (Main Issue):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that your program includes a `main` function that performs input reading and prints output in a format not expected by the judging system. The problem statement explicitly says: **"Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat."** This means only the `fusio` function itself should be submitted, without any `main` function or I/O code.
    *   Specifically, `print(n1+n2)` and `print(" ",end="")` generate output that is not part of the expected function return, leading to the error.
*   **External Library (`yogi`):** The `from yogi import read` import and its usage in `llegir_dades` is specific to how the Jutge.org platform might provide input. When submitting only the function, this import and related I/O logic are unnecessary and would cause issues if `yogi` is not available in the testing environment for the function-only submission.
*   **Type Hint Inconsistency (Minor):** In `llegir_dades`, the type hint `n:int` suggests `n` is an integer, but `read(float)` is used to read values into a list whose type hint is implicitly `list[int]` based on the function signature `->list[int]`. It should likely be `->list[float]` to match the `read(float)` calls and the `fusio` function's expectation of `list[float]`. However, this is minor compared to the Presentation Error.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Remove `main` Function and I/O Code (Crucial):** To fix the "Presentation Error" and adhere to the problem's instructions, you **must remove** the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades()` function, and the `from yogi import read` line. Submit *only* the `fusio` function definition.

    ```python
    # This is what you should submit:
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

2.  **Correct Type Hints in `llegir_dades` (If kept for local testing):** If you decide to keep the `main` and `llegir_dades` functions for local testing, adjust the type hint in `llegir_dades` to reflect that it reads floats:

    ```python
    def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]: # Changed list[int] to list[float]
        """Llegeix tots els nombres i els afegeix a la llista"""
        L = []
        for _ in range(n): # Use _ if i is not used
            x = read(float)
            L.append(x)
        return L
    ```

By following the first suggestion, your `fusio` function, which is excellently implemented, will pass the automatic judging system.
