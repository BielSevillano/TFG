### Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" asks for a function `fusio` that merges two pre-sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of numbers into a single sorted list. The merged list should retain all elements, including duplicates, and maintain the ascending order. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function implemented uses a standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of each input list (`v1` and `v2`) and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. It then iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to `llista_definitiva` and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is fully processed, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended to `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm, which is the standard and most efficient way to merge two sorted lists. It accurately handles comparisons and appends elements in the correct order.
2.  **Handles Remaining Elements:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` correctly appends any remaining elements from the list that was not fully traversed, ensuring all elements are included.
3.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm has optimal time complexity, O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. Each element from both input lists is visited and added to the result list exactly once.
4.  **Readability:** The code for the `fusio` function is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand. Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are descriptive.
5.  **Adherence to Interface:** The `fusio` function's signature `fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]` perfectly matches the problem's specified Python interface.

**Weaknesses:**
1.  **"Presentation Error" due to `main` function output:** The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means only the `fusio` function itself is evaluated. The "Presentation Error" indicates that the output generated by your `main` function (which includes reading input, printing `n1+n2`, and a leading space before the merged list) does not match the judge's expectations. Typically, for such problems, any output from the `main` or testing part of the code is not expected and will lead to this error.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove or Comment Out Testing Code for Submission:** The most important suggestion is to remove or comment out the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and the `from yogi import read` statement before submitting the solution. Your submission should ideally contain *only* the `fusio` function definition. If you wish to keep the testing code for local development, you can wrap it in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block and ensure it does not print anything or prints exactly what's expected for your local testing environment, knowing it won't be evaluated by the judge.

    *   **Example for submission (minimal code):**
        ```python
        def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
            i1 = 0
            i2 = 0
            llista_definitiva=[]
            while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
                if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                    i1 += 1
                else:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                    i2 += 1
            llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
            llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
            return llista_definitiva
        ```

In summary, your `fusio` function is excellently implemented and correctly solves the problem. The "Presentation Error" is purely an issue with the additional code used for input/output in the `main` function, which should be excluded or handled differently for submission.
