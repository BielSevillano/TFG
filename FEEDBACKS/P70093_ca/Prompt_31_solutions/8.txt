### Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks you to implement a function that merges two already sorted lists (or vectors/arrays) `v1` and `v2` into a single new list. The resulting list must also be sorted in ascending order, and all duplicate elements from both original lists must be preserved.

Your `fusio` function correctly implements a classic and efficient approach known as the **two-pointer (or merge) algorithm**. It uses two index pointers, one for each input list, to compare elements sequentially. The smaller element is appended to a new result list, and its corresponding pointer is advanced. This process continues until all elements from both lists have been added to the result.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The `fusio` function's logic is perfectly sound. It correctly merges two sorted lists, maintains the sorted order, and preserves all duplicate elements, exactly as described in the problem statement and demonstrated by the example.
    *   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach is highly efficient, having a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`, respectively. This is optimal as every element from both input lists must be examined at least once.
    *   **Readability:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are clear, and the overall structure of the merging loop is easy to understand.
    *   **Pythonic Handling of Remaining Elements:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant and efficient Pythonic way to append any remaining elements once one of the input lists has been fully processed.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **"Presentation Error" Cause:** The primary weakness, and the reason for the "Presentation Error", is that you've included a `main` function and auxiliary input-reading functions (`llegir_dades`) in your submission. The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This translates to "Only the requested procedure (function) needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored."
        *   Online judges typically expect *only* the function definition when this instruction is given. Any `main` function, input reading (`from yogi import read`), or output (`print`) statements outside the requested function will lead to a "Presentation Error" or similar, as the judge runs its own test framework around your submitted function.
        *   Even if a `main` function were allowed, your specific output format (`print(n1+n2)` followed by `print(" ",end="")` and then `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`) does not match standard output expectations unless explicitly specified, which it isn't in this case.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Crucial Correction for Submission:** To resolve the "Presentation Error", you must **remove everything except the `fusio` function definition** from your submission. This includes:
    *   `from yogi import read`
    *   The `llegir_dades` function
    *   The `main` function
    *   The `main()` call at the end

    Your submitted code should look exactly like this:
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # This covers cases where v1[i1] >= v2[i2]
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

*   **Minor (Docstring):** For good practice, consider adding a docstring to your `fusio` function to explain its purpose, parameters, and return value, even if the problem description already provides this information. This makes your code more self-documenting.
