### Feedback: Fusió de taules (Merge Sorted Lists)

**Problem Summary:**
The task is to implement a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers into a single sorted list, ensuring that all duplicate elements are preserved. The problem specifies that only the `fusio` function should be submitted, and any main program or I/O operations will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function employs a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at the current pointers. The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva` (final list), and its respective pointer is advanced. This process continues until one of the lists is exhausted. Finally, any remaining elements from the unexhausted list are appended to the `llista_definitiva`.

**Analysis of the Code:**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correct Algorithm (`fusio` function):** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm. It handles comparisons, duplicates (by appending both elements in their sorted order), and gracefully manages the remaining elements from either list after one has been fully processed.
2.  **Optimal Time Complexity:** The merge algorithm runs in O(N + M) time complexity, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is the most efficient approach for merging two already sorted lists.
3.  **Readability:** The `fusio` function is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).

**Weaknesses:**
1.  **Presentation Error (Main Cause):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that the submitted code includes a `main()` function and performs input/output operations (`from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, `print(...)`). The problem description explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) Competitive programming platforms expect only the specified function, not a full program with I/O, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
2.  **Incorrect Output Format in `main()`:** Even if a `main()` function were permitted, its output format deviates from standard expectations.
    *   `print(n1 + n2)`: Printing the total number of elements is not requested.
    *   `print(" ", end="")`: Printing a leading space before the list elements is usually considered a presentation error.
    *   The expected output typically consists only of the merged list elements, separated by spaces and followed by a newline.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Extraneous Code (Critical):** Before submitting, ensure that **only the `fusio` function** is present in your code. Remove the `from yogi import read` import, the `llegir_dades` function, the `main` function, and the `main()` call. This is the most crucial step to resolve the "Presentation Error".
2.  **Minor Type Hinting Consistency (Optional):** In `llegir_dades`, the type hint `->list[int]` is inconsistent with `x = read(float)` and `L.append(x)`, which reads and stores floats. While this function would be removed, it's good practice to ensure consistency if it were to be part of a larger project. The `fusio` function's type hints (`list[float]`) are correct.

The `fusio` function itself is well-implemented and correctly solves the problem's core logic. The "Presentation Error" is purely due to the surrounding code and output format.
