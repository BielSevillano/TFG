### Feedback: Fusió de taules (Merging Sorted Lists)

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem requires merging two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new sorted list, ensuring that all duplicate elements from both original lists are preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided `fusio` function implements a classic and efficient two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously using indices `i1` and `i2`. In each step, it compares the elements at the current pointers and appends the smaller one to a new `llista_definitiva`. The corresponding pointer is then advanced. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are simply appended to the result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm, which is an optimal approach for this problem, guaranteeing an `O(N+M)` time complexity (where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively) and maintaining sorted order while preserving duplicates.
*   **Clear and Readable:** The code within `fusio` is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are descriptive.
*   **Efficient Handling of Remaining Elements:** The use of `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant and efficient way to append any remaining elements after one of the lists has been fully processed.

**Weaknesses and Reason for "Presentation Error":**

*   **Violation of Problem Instructions (Main Function):** The problem statement explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) Including the `main()` function and the input/output logic means that the program, when run on the evaluation system, produces output that is not expected.
*   **Output Formatting in `main` (if executed):** The "Presentation Error" indicates that even if the `main` function *were* to be considered, its output format does not precisely match the expected format.
    *   **Unnecessary Line:** `print(n1+n2)` prints the total number of elements on a separate line, which is almost certainly not expected as part of the output for the merged list.
    *   **Leading Space:** The sequence `print(" ",end="")` followed by `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` will result in a leading space before the first element of the merged list. For example, instead of `2 3 3 5 5 5 7`, it would print ` 2 3 3 5 5 5 7`. A leading space is a very common cause of "Presentation Error" on automated judges.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Adhere to Submission Guidelines (Crucial):** The most important improvement is to **remove the `main` function and all input/output related code** (`read`, `llegir_dades`, `print` statements). Your submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function, as specified by the problem statement. This will directly resolve the "Presentation Error".

    ```python
    # This is what should be submitted:
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # v1[i1] >= v2[i2]
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

2.  **For Local Testing (If a `main` is desired):** If you keep a `main` function for your personal local testing, ensure its output format is absolutely precise.
    *   Avoid extraneous output like `n1+n2`.
    *   To print a list of elements separated by single spaces without a leading or trailing space, `print(*merged_list)` is generally the correct Python idiom.

    ```python
    # Example of a main function for LOCAL TESTING only,
    # if you want to test locally and get correct output formatting
    # (Do NOT submit this main function to Jutge.org)
    from yogi import read

    def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[float]: # Changed type hint to float
        L = []
        for _ in range(n): # Use _ if loop variable is not needed
            x = read(float)
            L.append(x)
        return L

    def main():
        n1 = read(int)
        v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
        n2 = read(int)
        v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
        
        merged_result = fusio(v1, v2)
        # Correct way to print elements separated by spaces, without leading/trailing space
        print(*merged_result) 

    # if __name__ == "__main__":
    #    main()
    ```

By submitting only the `fusio` function as requested, your solution should pass, as the core merging logic is robust and correct.
