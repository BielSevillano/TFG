### Feedback for the "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks to implement a function `fusio` that merges two pre-sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers into a single new sorted list. Crucially, the function must preserve all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The problem statement also specifies that only the `fusio` function should be submitted, and any main program or auxiliary functions will be ignored.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program defines the `fusio` function using a classic two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of `v1` and `v2` respectively, and an empty list `llista_definitiva` to store the merged result. It then iterates while both pointers are within their respective list bounds, comparing elements `v1[i1]` and `v2[i2]`. The smaller element is appended to `llista_definitiva`, and its corresponding pointer is incremented. If elements are equal, `v2[i2]` is appended (and `i2` incremented), effectively maintaining stability and preserving duplicates. After one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended using `extend`.

The program also includes auxiliary functions `llegir_dades` to read input and a `main` function to demonstrate the usage, reading list sizes and elements, calling `fusio`, and printing the result.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm for sorted lists. It accurately handles duplicates as required and produces a correctly sorted combined list.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm is efficient, running in linear time complexity, O(len(v1) + len(v2)), as each element from both input lists is processed exactly once.
*   **Clarity:** The logic within the `fusio` function is straightforward and easy to understand, with clear variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).
*   **Pythonic Handling of Remaining Elements:** Using `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is a concise and efficient Pythonic way to append the remaining elements from whichever list hasn't been fully traversed.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Violation of Submission Requirements (Main Cause of Presentation Error):** The primary weakness is the inclusion and execution of the `main` function and `llegir_dades`. The problem explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.). The `main` function prints extra information (`n1+n2`) and formats the output with an initial space, which does not match the expected output format of a typical Jutge.org problem expecting only the function's logic. This mismatch in output is the direct cause of the "Presentation Error".
*   **Minor Type Hint Inconsistency (in `llegir_dades`):** The `llegir_dades` function is type-hinted to return `list[int]`, but it reads `float` values using `read(float)`. While floats can represent integers, `list[float]` would be a more accurate type hint if floats are indeed read. (This is minor and irrelevant if `main` and `llegir_dades` are removed).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adhere Strictly to Submission Requirements:** For submission to Jutge.org, **remove or comment out the `main` function and any auxiliary functions like `llegir_dades`**. Only the `fusio` function and its definition should be present in the submitted file. This will resolve the "Presentation Error".
    ```python
    # REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT FOR SUBMISSION:
    # from yogi import read
    # def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:
    #     L = []
    #     for i in range(n):
    #         x = read(float)
    #         L.append(x)
    #     return L
    # def main():
    #     n1 = read(int)
    #     v1 = llegir_dades(n1)
    #     n2 = read(int)
    #     v2 = llegir_dades(n2)
    #     print(n1+n2) # This line specifically caused unexpected output
    #     print(" ",end="") # This line also contributed to Presentation Error
    #     print(*fusio(v1,v2))
    # main()
    ```

2.  **Add Docstrings:** While not strictly necessary for this platform, adding a docstring to the `fusio` function is good practice for explaining its purpose, parameters, and what it returns.
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        """
        Merges two sorted lists of floats into a single sorted list,
        preserving duplicate elements.

        Args:
            v1 (list[float]): The first sorted list.
            v2 (list[float]): The second sorted list.

        Returns:
            list[float]: A new list containing all elements from v1 and v2,
                          sorted and with duplicates preserved.
        """
        # ... (rest of your existing fusio code)
    ```

By making just the first suggested change, your solution will likely pass the tests for correctness, as the `fusio` function itself is well-implemented.
