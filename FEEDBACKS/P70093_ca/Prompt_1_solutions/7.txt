### Feedback for Fusió de Taules Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of numbers into a single sorted list, preserving any duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

The provided `fusio` function implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It uses two indices (`i1` and `i2`) to iterate through `v1` and `v2` simultaneously. In each step, it compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appends the smaller one to a new list (`llista_definitiva`), and advances the corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, all remaining elements from the other list are appended to the result.

**2. Code Analysis (Strengths and Weaknesses):**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness of `fusio`:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge logic for two sorted lists. It handles duplicate elements as required and produces a correctly sorted merged list.
*   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach within `fusio` is highly efficient. It processes each element from both input lists exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`. This is optimal for this problem.
*   **Readability of `fusio`:** The `fusio` function is relatively clear and easy to understand, following the standard merge algorithm structure.

**Weaknesses and Cause of "Presentation Error":**

*   **Violation of Submission Guidelines:** The problem statement explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Your submission includes a `main` function, along with helper functions (`llegir_dades`) and `yogi` imports for reading input. This is the primary reason for the "Presentation Error" as the platform expects only the `fusio` function definition.
*   **Unnecessary Input/Output Logic:** The `main` function also prints the sum of the lengths of the input arrays (`n1 + n2`) and then prints the merged list prefixed by a space. This output format is likely not what the judging system expects, even if a `main` function were allowed. The problem's interface only specifies the function signature, implying the judging system will call this function directly with predefined inputs and check its return value.
*   **Pythonic Style (Minor):** Variable names like `llista_definitiva` are descriptive but could follow standard Python `snake_case` conventions (e.g., `final_list` or `merged_list`) for consistency, though this is a minor point.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adhere Strictly to Submission Requirements:** The most critical improvement is to **remove the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and the `from yogi import read` import statement.** Your submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function as defined by the problem's interface:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # v1[i1] >= v2[i2]
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

    By submitting only this function, you will resolve the "Presentation Error."

2.  **Consider Pythonic Naming (Optional):** Rename `llista_definitiva` to `merged_list` or `result_list` for better adherence to common Python naming conventions.

The core `fusio` function is well-implemented and efficient for the task. The issues lie solely in the extraneous code surrounding it, which violates the platform's submission instructions.
