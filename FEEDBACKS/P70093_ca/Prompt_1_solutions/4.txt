### Feedback for the Merge Sorted Lists Program

#### 1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach

The problem requires implementing a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new sorted list. Crucially, duplicate elements must be preserved. For instance, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python program correctly employs the standard **two-pointer merge algorithm**. It initializes two pointers, one for each input list, and iteratively compares the elements pointed to. The smaller element is appended to a new result list, and its corresponding pointer is advanced. This process continues until one of the lists is exhausted, after which the remaining elements of the other list are simply appended to the result.

#### 2. Code Analysis

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The `fusio` function is a well-implemented and correct solution to the merging problem. It accurately combines the two sorted lists, preserving duplicates, and maintaining the sorted order of the final list.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` has a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal as every element from both input lists must be visited at least once. The space complexity is also O(N + M) for storing the result list.
*   **Readability:** The code for `fusio` is clear and easy to understand, following standard Python conventions.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Violation of Submission Requirements (Main Cause of "Presentation Error"):** The most significant issue is the presence of the `main` function and all related input/output code (`llegir_dades`, `read`, `print` statements). The problem description explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.). Online judges typically expect *only* the function signature and its implementation. Any output generated by a `main` function when not explicitly requested leads to a "Presentation Error" because the output format does not match the judge's expectations (which are usually none, in this case).
*   **Minor Type Hint Inconsistency:** In the `llegir_dades` function, the type hint `n:int` and `->list[int]` is inconsistent with `read(float)` and the problem statement expecting `double`/`float` values. It should be `->list[float]`. While this doesn't cause a runtime error in Python, it's good practice for clarity and static analysis.

#### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Remove all non-essential code:** To resolve the "Presentation Error" and adhere to the problem's instructions, delete the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and all `yogi.read` and `print` calls. Your submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function definition.

    ```python
    # from yogi import read # This line should also be removed if not used by the function itself

    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva

    # The rest of the original code (llegir_dades, main) should be deleted for submission.
    ```
2.  **Correct Type Hints (if `llegir_dades` were to be kept):** If for some reason the `llegir_dades` function was intended to be part of a larger local testing script, ensure its type hints are accurate: `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[float]:`. However, for submission, it should be removed entirely.

By following the first suggestion, your program will correctly pass the judge's tests, as the `fusio` function itself is robust and efficient.
