### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists of numbers (`v1` and `v2`) into a single new sorted list. Crucially, duplicate elements should be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order. The task specifically requires submitting *only* the `fusio` procedure.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function correctly implements a classic two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It uses two indices, `i1` and `i2`, to iterate through `v1` and `v2` respectively. In each step, it compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2` and appends the smaller one to `llista_definitiva`, advancing the corresponding pointer. Once one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are efficiently appended to the result using `extend`.

**Code Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function's logic is perfectly sound and correctly implements the merge algorithm for sorted lists, preserving duplicates.
2.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm runs in O(N + M) time complexity, where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`, respectively. This is optimal as it requires examining each element from both input lists at most once. The space complexity is also O(N + M) for the new merged list.
3.  **Clear Variable Names:** Variable names like `llista_definitiva`, `i1`, and `i2` are clear and descriptive.
4.  **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `-> list[float]`) is good practice for code readability and maintainability, though one minor inaccuracy was present in the `llegir_dades` function.

**Weaknesses and Cause of "Presentation Error":**

1.  **Violation of Submission Requirements (Primary Issue):** The problem statement clearly specifies: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Your submission includes a `main()` function, a `llegir_dades()` helper function, and an import `from yogi import read`. The "Presentation Error" indicates that your program produced output or performed I/O (like reading input or printing to console) that was not expected by the judge, or that the structure of the submission was incorrect (i.e., it contained more than just the `fusio` function). The judging system typically calls the required function directly with specific inputs and checks its return value.

2.  **Minor Type Hint Inaccuracy (in `llegir_dades`):** The function `llegir_dades` is declared to return `list[int]` (`->list[int]`), but it reads `float` values using `read(float)`. If this helper function were to be used, its return type hint should be `list[float]`. However, this is irrelevant for the current problem as the `main` function and its helpers should not be submitted.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Extraneous Code:** The most critical step to resolve the "Presentation Error" is to **remove everything except the `fusio` function**. This includes the `main()` function, the `llegir_dades()` function, and the `from yogi import read` import. Submit only the `fusio` function as requested by the problem.

    **Example of what should be submitted:**
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

By submitting only the requested function, your efficient and correct implementation of `fusio` should pass the tests.
