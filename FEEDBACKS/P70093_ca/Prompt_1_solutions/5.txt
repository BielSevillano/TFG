This feedback concerns your Python program for the "Fusió de taules" problem.

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem asks to implement a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your `fusio` function correctly implements a standard two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at the current pointers (`i1` and `i2`). The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva` (final list), and its corresponding pointer is advanced. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended directly to the `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm for sorted lists, handling duplicates as required. Its logic is sound and produces the expected output for the core problem.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`, respectively. This is optimal for merging two sorted lists.
    *   **Readability:** The `fusio` function itself is well-structured and easy to understand.
    *   **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float] -> list[float]`) is good practice for Python code, improving clarity and maintainability.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **"Presentation Error" Cause (Crucial):** The problem statement explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.)
        *   Your submission includes a `main` function, input reading logic (`llegir_dades`, `yogi.read`), and output printing. This part of the code is not expected by the grading system.
        *   Any output produced by your `main` function (like `print(n1+n2)` or `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`) when the platform only expects the *function definition* will result in a "Presentation Error" or similar. The system only calls your `fusio` function with predefined inputs and checks its return value.
    *   **Minor Inconsistency in `llegir_dades` (if it were allowed):** The type hint for `llegir_dades`'s return value is `list[int]`, but it reads `float`s (`read(float)`). While this function shouldn't be submitted, it's a minor point to note.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Remove Extraneous Code (Most Important):** To resolve the "Presentation Error" and correctly submit your solution, you **must remove everything except the `fusio` function definition**.
    *   Delete `from yogi import read`.
    *   Delete the `llegir_dades` function.
    *   Delete the `main` function.
    *   Delete the `main()` call.
    *   Your submitted file should *only* contain:
        ```python
        def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
            i1 = 0
            i2 = 0
            llista_definitiva=[]
            while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
                if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                    i1 += 1
                else:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                    i2 += 1
            llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
            llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
            return llista_definitiva
        ```

*   **Self-Correction on Reference Solutions:** The provided C++ code in the "other possible solutions" section appears to be for a completely different problem (manipulating time structures). It is not relevant to this problem or your Python solution and can be disregarded.

By making the suggested change of removing the `main` function and related input/output code, your solution should pass the tests, as the `fusio` function itself is correctly implemented.
