### Feedback for "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks for a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers and merges them into a single sorted list, preserving duplicates. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your solution correctly implements the classic two-pointer (or merge) algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to the beginning of each input list and iteratively compares the elements pointed to. The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva`, and its respective pointer is advanced. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended directly to the result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Logic for `fusio` function:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merging algorithm for two sorted lists. It handles duplicates as required and produces the expected sorted output.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used is highly efficient, running in linear time complexity, O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for this problem.
*   **Clarity:** The code for the `fusio` function is relatively clear and easy to understand.
*   **Pythonic Use of `extend`:** Using `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is an elegant and efficient way to handle the remaining elements after one list is fully processed.

**Weaknesses & Cause of "Presentation Error":**

*   **Violating Problem Instructions (Main Program Submission):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is that your submission includes a `main` function and input/output logic (`yogi.read`, `llegir_dades`, `print` statements). The problem statement explicitly says: **"Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat."** This means you should *only* submit the `fusio` function itself, without any `main` block, helper input functions, or print statements.
*   **Incorrect Output Format (due to `main`):** Even if a `main` function were allowed, your specific `print` statements (`print(n1+n2)`, `print(" ",end="")`) produce output that doesn't match any standard problem format, hence the "Presentation Error." The judge expects either no output (if only a function is to be evaluated) or a very specific output format.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove `main` function and related code:**
    *   Delete the `from yogi import read` line.
    *   Delete the `llegir_dades` function.
    *   Delete the `main` function entirely.
    *   Delete the `main()` call at the end.
    *   Your submitted code should *only* contain the `fusio` function definition.

    **Example of what should be submitted:**
    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

**In summary:** Your `fusio` function is excellently implemented and correctly solves the problem's core logic. The "Presentation Error" is solely due to including extraneous code (the `main` function and associated input/output) that the problem statement explicitly stated would be ignored or should not be submitted. Remove all parts of the program except the `fusio` function, and it should pass.
