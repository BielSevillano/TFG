### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists (or vectors) of floating-point numbers, `v1` and `v2`, and merges them into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`. The precondition is that both input lists are sorted from smallest to largest.

**Solution Approach:**
The `fusio` function implements the classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both lists simultaneously using indices `i1` and `i2`. In each step, it compares the elements at the current pointers and appends the smaller one to a new `llista_definitiva` (final list), advancing the corresponding pointer. After one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list to the `llista_definitiva`.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correct Algorithm for `fusio`:** The core `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm, which is the standard and most efficient approach for this problem given the sorted input. It's an O(N+M) solution, where N and M are the lengths of the input lists.
2.  **Handles Duplicates:** The `else` branch correctly handles cases where `v2[i2]` is less than or equal to `v1[i1]`, ensuring that duplicate elements (like multiple `3`s or `5`s in the example) are preserved in their correct sorted order.
3.  **Handles Remaining Elements:** The `extend` calls after the main `while` loop are crucial and correctly manage the scenario where one input list is longer than the other, ensuring all elements are included in the final merged list.
4.  **Readability:** The code is clear and easy to understand, following logical steps for the merge operation.

**Weaknesses:**
1.  **Submission Format (Critical):** The "Observació" clearly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) The student submitted a complete program including `from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, and the `main()` function with custom input/output. This is the direct cause of the "Presentation Error". Online judges typically only expect the function signature and its implementation, and they will call this function with their own test cases. Printing anything, or using external libraries like `yogi` (unless explicitly allowed and set up) outside the function, will cause errors.
2.  **Minor Type Hint Inconsistency:** In `llegir_dades`, the type hint is `->list[int]`, but it reads `float` values using `read(float)` and appends them. While Python's dynamic typing allows this to work, it's an inconsistency. For clarity, it should be `->list[float]`. (This is a very minor point and irrelevant for the actual "Presentation Error".)

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Strictly Adhere to Submission Instructions:** For online judges, it is paramount to only submit the code explicitly requested. In this case, **only the `fusio` function** should be submitted. Remove the `import yogi`, `llegir_dades`, and `main()` functions entirely.
2.  **Local Testing Strategy:** When developing, it's good practice to write `main` functions for local testing. However, be prepared to remove them before submission to an online judge that specifies "only the procedure".
3.  **Correct Type Hints (Minor):** If the `llegir_dades` function were to be kept for local testing, change its return type hint to `list[float]` to accurately reflect the data type being read and stored.

**Note on "Other Possible Solutions":**
The provided "other possible solutions" in C++ appear to be solving a completely different problem (e.g., finding the `k` most frequent words in a list, based on variable names like `par`, `string`, `compt`, `freq`, `max`, `k`). They are not relevant to the "Fusió de taules" problem and thus have not been used for comparison with the student's Python solution.
