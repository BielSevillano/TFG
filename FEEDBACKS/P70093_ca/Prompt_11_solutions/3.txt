### Feedback on "Fusió de taules" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires merging two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of numbers into a single new list. This new list must also be sorted and include all elements from both input lists, preserving any duplicates. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python solution correctly implements a standard two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements and appending the smaller one to a new result list. Once one list is exhausted, it appends any remaining elements from the other list to the result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **`fusio` Function Correctness:** The core `fusio` function is exceptionally well-implemented. It correctly applies the two-pointer (or merge) algorithm to combine two sorted lists into a single sorted list, accurately handling duplicates and the cases where one list is longer than the other.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` has a time complexity of O(N+M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists. This is optimal for this problem, as every element must be visited at least once.
    *   **Readability:** The `fusio` function's logic is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
    *   **Adherence to Logic:** The `fusio` function perfectly matches the problem's requirement for merging sorted lists without removing duplicates.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **`main` Function and "Presentation Error":** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is the presence and output of the `main` function. The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.)
        *   This means the testing system expects *only* the `fusio` function definition. Any code outside of `fusio`, especially output from a `main` function (like printing `n1+n2` or extra spaces), will be considered incorrect output or unexpected code, leading to a "Presentation Error."
        *   The `print(n1+n2)` and `print(" ",end="")` lines in particular produce output that is not requested by the problem description.
    *   **Unnecessary Imports/Functions:** Since the `main` program is ignored, the `from yogi import read` import and the `llegir_dades` function are also superfluous in the submitted code, as they are only used by the `main` function.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove the `main` Function and Auxiliary Input/Output:** The most critical improvement is to remove the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and the `from yogi import read` import. Your submission should consist *solely* of the `fusio` function definition.

    ```python
    # This is the only part that should be submitted
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # Handles v2[i2] <= v1[i1], including equality
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:]) # Append remaining elements from v1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:]) # Append remaining elements from v2
        return llista_definitiva
    ```

By making this change, the "Presentation Error" will be resolved, as the submitted code will conform exactly to the problem's requirements. The `fusio` function itself is a perfect solution to the merging problem.
