### Feedback: Fusió de taules (Table Merge)

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a function `fusio` that takes two pre-sorted lists of floating-point numbers (`v1` and `v2`) and merges them into a single new list that is also sorted, preserving all duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The submitted Python program correctly implements the standard "two-pointer" merge algorithm within the `fusio` function. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at the current pointers (`i1` and `i2`). The smaller element is appended to the `llista_definitiva` (final list), and its respective pointer is advanced. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are simply appended to the final list.

**Code Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function implements the merge algorithm flawlessly. It correctly handles the comparison, element appending, duplicate preservation (by appending `v2[i2]` when `v1[i1] == v2[i2]`), and the efficient handling of remaining elements with `extend`.
2.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm used is highly efficient, with a time complexity of O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively. This is optimal for merging two sorted lists.
3.  **Readability:** The code is clear and easy to understand. Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are descriptive.
4.  **Pythonic Usage:** The use of `list.extend()` for appending remaining sub-lists is concise and idiomatic Python.

**Code Weaknesses and Suggestions for Improvement:**

The "Presentation Error" arises not from the `fusio` function itself, which is correct, but from the way the `main` function handles the output.

1.  **Output Format (Primary Issue - Presentation Error):**
    *   The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be sent; the main program will be ignored.) However, the "Presentation Error" indicates that the output generated by your `main` function was evaluated and did not match the expected format.
    *   Your `main` function prints `n1+n2` on one line, and then the merged list on a *separate* line with a leading space.
    *   **Suggestion:** For online judges, a "Presentation Error" means the output is correct data but in the wrong format. If `main` is truly ignored, you should submit *only* the `fusio` function. If it is evaluated for local testing, the most likely expected output format for a list of numbers would be just the numbers themselves, separated by spaces, on a single line, without any prefix like the total length.
        *   **To fix for local testing (if main is evaluated):** Remove the line `print(n1+n2)` and modify the printing of the list to remove the leading space, if not desired. A typical single-line output might look like this: `print(*fusio(v1, v2))`.

2.  **Unnecessary `main` and `llegir_dades` (if only `fusio` is required):**
    *   As per the problem statement, only the `fusio` function is required. Including `main` and `llegir_dades` (while useful for local testing) is technically extraneous for submission and can sometimes lead to issues if their output or side effects are unintentionally evaluated.
    *   **Suggestion:** When submitting to a platform like Jutge, if the problem explicitly states only a specific function is required, it's best practice to submit only that function.

**Conclusion:**

Your `fusio` function is an excellent and correct implementation of the merge algorithm for sorted lists. The "Presentation Error" is solely due to the output format produced by your `main` function, which might have been unexpectedly evaluated. By removing the extraneous `main` and `llegir_dades` functions or adjusting the output format of `main` to match exact requirements (typically just the merged list elements separated by spaces), your solution would pass without issues.
