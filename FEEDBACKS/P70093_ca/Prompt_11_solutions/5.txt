**Feedback for `fusio` program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a function `fusio` that merges two pre-sorted lists of numbers (`v1`, `v2`) into a single sorted list, preserving all duplicate elements. The provided Python solution implements this merge using a standard two-pointer approach. The `fusio` function iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements and appending the smaller one to a new list until one of the input lists is exhausted. It then appends any remaining elements from the other list.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merge algorithm. It uses a two-pointer approach (variables `i1` and `i2`) to efficiently combine the two sorted input lists into a single sorted output list. This approach has optimal time complexity (O(len(v1) + len(v2))).
*   **Handling Duplicates:** The algorithm correctly preserves all duplicate elements, as specified in the problem description (e.g., if '3' appears in both lists, it appears twice in the merged list, plus any other occurrences).
*   **Readability:** The `fusio` function's logic is clear and easy to follow, and variable names like `llista_definitiva` are descriptive.
*   **Correct Data Types:** The `fusio` function correctly operates on `float` values, aligning with the problem's interface definition.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Presentation Error in `main` function:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" lies in the output format produced by the `main` function.
    *   The line `print(n1+n2)` prints the total number of elements, which is generally not expected output for this type of merging problem and leads to extraneous information.
    *   The line `print(" ",end="")` introduces an unnecessary leading space before the merged list elements, which is a common cause of "Presentation Error" in automated judging systems like Jutge.org.
*   **Type Hint Inconsistency:** In the `llegir_dades` function, the return type hint is `list[int]`, but the function actually reads `float` values using `read(float)` and appends them to the list. The return type should thus be `list[float]` for consistency and correctness in type checking.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Rectify Output Format (Address Presentation Error):**
    *   Remove the line `print(n1+n2)` from the `main()` function, as this output is not requested by the problem description.
    *   Modify the way the merged list is printed to avoid the leading space and ensure only the merged elements are shown. The simplest and most common approach is:
        ```python
        # Original lines in main():
        # print(n1+n2)
        # print(" ",end="")
        # print(*fusio(v1,v2))

        # Suggested change:
        print(*fusio(v1, v2))
        ```
        This change will print the elements of the merged list separated by single spaces, followed by a newline, which is the standard expected output format for such problems.

2.  **Correct Type Hint in `llegir_dades`:**
    *   Update the type hint for the `llegir_dades` function to accurately reflect that it returns a list of floating-point numbers:
        ```python
        # Original:
        # def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[int]:

        # Suggested change:
        def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[float]:
        ```
        This improves code clarity and ensures type hints are accurate.

By implementing these suggestions, particularly the output format correction in `main()`, the program should pass the "Presentation Error" and correctly solve the problem.
