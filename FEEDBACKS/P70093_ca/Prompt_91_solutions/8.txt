**Feedback for "Fusió de taules" program**

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires merging two input lists (`v1` and `v2`), both guaranteed to be already sorted in ascending order, into a single new list that is also sorted. Crucially, duplicate elements must be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python solution implements the classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It initializes two pointers (`i1` and `i2`) to track the current position in `v1` and `v2`, respectively. It iteratively compares the elements pointed to by `i1` and `i2`, appending the smaller element to a `llista_definitiva` (final list) and advancing its corresponding pointer. Once one of the input lists is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other list are simply appended to the `llista_definitiva`. This approach efficiently builds the merged sorted list in a single pass.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm, which is the most efficient approach for this problem (O(N+M) time complexity, where N and M are the lengths of the input lists).
*   **Clear Logic:** The logic within `fusio` is straightforward and easy to understand, reflecting a good grasp of the algorithm.
*   **Readability:** Variable names like `i1`, `i2`, and `llista_definitiva` are reasonably descriptive and contribute to the code's readability.

**Weaknesses and Cause of "Presentation Error":**

*   **Incorrect Submission Scope:** The problem statement explicitly mentions: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means only the `fusio` function (and any helper functions *directly used by* `fusio` in its core logic) should be submitted. The `main` function and the `llegir_dades` function are typically for local testing and should be removed before submission to the judge system.
*   **Superfluous Output in `main`:** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is likely the extra output generated by the `main` function:
    *   `print(n1+n2)`: The total number of elements (`n1+n2`) is printed on a separate line, which is not requested by the problem and would cause a presentation mismatch.
    *   `print(" ",end="")`: This prints an extra leading space before the actual merged list, which is generally not expected in competitive programming output and can cause a "Presentation Error".
*   **Minor Type Hinting Inconsistency:** The `llegir_dades` function is declared to return `list[int]` (`->list[int]`), but it reads `float` values (`x = read(float)`). While floats can represent integers, it's more accurate to hint that it returns `list[float]`. This is a minor point and does not affect the program's correctness or the "Presentation Error".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Remove `main` Function for Submission:** When submitting to a platform like Jutge.org for problems like this, ensure you only provide the `fusio` function. Delete the `main` function, `llegir_dades`, and the `from yogi import read` line (as `read` won't be used by `fusio` directly in this problem).
    *   *If a `main` function were required for I/O:* Modify the `main` function to produce *only* the merged list, space-separated, on a single line, without the total count or leading/trailing spaces. For example: `print(*fusio(v1,v2))`.
2.  **Correct Type Hinting:** Change the signature of `llegir_dades` to `def llegir_dades(n:int)->list[float]:` to accurately reflect the type of elements it reads.
3.  **Pythonic `llegir_dades` (Optional):** The `llegir_dades` function can be written more concisely using a list comprehension:
    ```python
    def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]:
        return [read(float) for _ in range(n)]
    ```

By addressing the submission scope and output format issues, your excellent `fusio` function will pass the "Presentation Error" and likely achieve an "Accepted" status.
