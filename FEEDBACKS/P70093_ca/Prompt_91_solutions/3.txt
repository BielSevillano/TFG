### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers into a single sorted list, preserving any duplicate elements. The program implements this using a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements at the current pointers and appending the smaller element to a new list. Pointers are advanced accordingly. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended to the result.

**Code Strengths:**

1.  **Correct `fusio` implementation:** The core `fusio` function correctly implements the two-pointer merge algorithm. It efficiently combines the two sorted lists into a single sorted list, handling duplicates as required. Its time complexity is optimal, O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`.
2.  **Readability:** The variable names (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`) are clear and the logic is easy to follow.
3.  **Pythonic list extension:** The use of `extend(v1[i1:])` and `extend(v2[i2:])` is an efficient and clean way to add remaining elements from a list after one of the input lists has been fully processed.
4.  **Type Hinting:** The use of type hints (`v1: list[float]`, `v2: list[float]`, `-> list[float]`) is excellent practice for code clarity and maintainability.

**Code Weaknesses and Reason for "Presentation Error":**

1.  **Violation of Submission Instructions (Primary Issue):** The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.) Your submission includes a `main()` function and `llegir_dades()` function, which perform input/output operations. The "Presentation Error" almost certainly occurs because your `main()` function prints additional information (`n1+n2` and a space) that is not expected by the automated judge system. The judge expects to call your `fusio` function directly and verify its return value, without any custom input reading or additional print statements.
2.  **Inconsistent Type Hint in `llegir_dades`:** The `llegir_dades` function reads `float` values (`read(float)`) but its type hint specifies `->list[int]`. While this is a minor issue that doesn't affect the `fusio` function's correctness for float inputs, it's an inconsistency. The problem statement itself asks for `double` / `float` arrays/lists.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Non-Essential Code:** The most crucial step to resolve the "Presentation Error" is to remove the `main()` function and the `llegir_dades()` function from your submission. Only the `fusio` function should be present. The judge system will provide its own tests for `fusio`.
    *   **Example of what to submit:**
        ```python
        def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
            i1 = 0
            i2 = 0
            llista_definitiva=[]
            while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
                if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                    i1 += 1
                else:
                    llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                    i2 += 1
            llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
            llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
            return llista_definitiva
        ```
2.  **Correct Type Hint (Minor):** If you were to keep `llegir_dades` (which you shouldn't for this problem), its type hint should be `def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]:` to match `read(float)`.

By following the first suggestion, your `fusio` function should pass the tests, as its logic is correct and efficient.
