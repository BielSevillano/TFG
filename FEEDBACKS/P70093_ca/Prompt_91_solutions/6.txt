### Feedback: Fusió de taules

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" requires implementing a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers into a single new sorted list, preserving any duplicate elements. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

Your `fusio` function correctly addresses this by using a standard two-pointer (or two-iterator) merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements and appending the smaller one to a new `llista_definitiva`. Once one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends the remaining elements of the other list.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function implements the classic merge algorithm for sorted lists, which is highly efficient with a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input lists.
    *   **Clear and Readable Logic:** The use of `i1` and `i2` as pointers is straightforward, and the `while` loop correctly handles the merging process.
    *   **Efficient Handling of Remaining Elements:** Using `llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])` and `llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])` is a Pythonic and efficient way to append the remaining parts of the lists after the main merge loop finishes.
    *   **Type Hinting:** The `fusio` function includes appropriate type hints (`v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]`), which is good practice for code clarity and maintainability.

*   **Weaknesses (Leading to "Presentation Error"):**
    *   **Submission Requirement Mismatch:** The core reason for the "Presentation Error" is that the problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means only the `fusio` function (and any helper functions *called by `fusio`*) should be submitted. Your submission includes a `main` function, an `llegir_dades` helper function, and input/output calls (`read`, `print`). The automated judging system likely executed the `fusio` function directly with its own test cases, and the unexpected input reading (`read`) and output (`print`) from your `main` function caused the presentation error.
    *   **Unspecified Output Format:** Even if a `main` function were allowed, the problem does not specify the format for a full program's output. Your `main` function prints the sum of list lengths (`n1 + n2`) and then the merged list with a leading space (`print(" ",end="")`). This custom output format would almost certainly not match any expected output, contributing to a presentation error.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Crucial Correction (Address Presentation Error):** **Remove the `main` function, the `llegir_dades` function, and all calls to `read` and `print` from your submission.** Only the `fusio` function should remain. This is the most important change to make for your solution to be accepted by the judging system. You can keep these functions for local testing if you wish, but they must not be submitted.
2.  **Docstrings:** Add a docstring to the `fusio` function to clearly describe its purpose, arguments, and what it returns. This improves code documentation.

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        """
        Merges two sorted lists of floats into a single sorted list, preserving duplicates.

        Precondition: v1 and v2 are sorted in ascending order.

        Args:
            v1: The first sorted list of floats.
            v2: The second sorted list of floats.

        Returns:
            A new list containing all elements from v1 and v2, merged and sorted.
        """
        # ... (rest of your fusio function code)
    ```

3.  **Remove Unused Imports:** If `yogi` is only used in your `main` function (which should be removed), then `from yogi import read` should also be removed from the submitted code.

Your `fusio` function itself is a correct and efficient solution to the merging problem. The issue lies purely with adhering to the submission requirements for the problem.
