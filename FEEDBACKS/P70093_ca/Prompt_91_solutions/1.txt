### Feedback for 'Fusió de taules' Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Fusió de taules" asks for a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists (vectors) of floating-point numbers, `v1` and `v2`, and merges them into a single, new sorted list. The merged list should retain all elements, including duplicates, in ascending order. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

**Solution Approach:**
Your `fusio` function implements the standard two-pointer (or two-iterator) merge algorithm, which is highly suitable for this problem given the input lists are already sorted. It iterates through both lists simultaneously, always picking the smaller element from the current pointers and appending it to a new result list. After one list is exhausted, it efficiently appends any remaining elements from the other list.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness of `fusio` function:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the merging logic. It handles duplicates as required and correctly appends any remaining elements after one of the input lists is fully processed.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used by `fusio` is optimal, with a time complexity of O(N + M) (where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2` respectively) because each element is visited and appended exactly once. The space complexity is also O(N + M) for storing the new merged list.
    *   **Readability:** The code for `fusio` is clear and easy to understand, with well-named variables (`i1`, `i2`, `llista_definitiva`).

*   **Weaknesses & Root Cause of "Presentation Error":**
    *   The problem statement explicitly states: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." (Only the requested procedure needs to be submitted; the main program will be ignored.)
    *   Your submission includes a `main` function and supporting functions (`llegir_dades`, `read`) that perform input/output operations (`read`, `print`). While these might be useful for local testing, the online judge typically calls the `fusio` function directly with its own test data and expects no other output.
    *   The "Presentation Error" almost certainly arises because the output generated by your `main` function (printing `n1+n2`, a space, and then the merged list) does not match the judge's expected output format for its own test harness (which would likely just call `fusio` and check its return value, or print the result of `fusio` in a specific format if it were a full program problem).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Superfluous Code:** For this problem, you should **remove the entire `main` function**, the `llegir_dades` function, and the `from yogi import read` line. Only the `fusio` function is required for submission.

    ```python
    # This is all that's needed for the submission:
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva = []
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Adherence to Problem Specifications:** Always pay close attention to the "Observació" or similar notes in problem statements, especially regarding what parts of the code are expected for submission. This will help avoid "Presentation Error" and "Wrong Answer" errors due to unexpected I/O.
