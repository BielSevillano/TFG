### Feedback on "Fusió de taules"

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Fusió de taules" asks for a function `fusio` that merges two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers into a single, combined sorted list. The function should retain all duplicate elements.

Your `fusio` function correctly implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements at the current pointers. The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva`, and its respective pointer is advanced. Once one list is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are simply appended to the result.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness of `fusio`:** The `fusio` function is well-implemented and correctly merges the two sorted lists, preserving order and duplicates as specified.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm used in `fusio` has a time complexity of O(N + M) and a space complexity of O(N + M) (where N and M are the lengths of `v1` and `v2`), which is optimal for this problem.
    *   **Readability:** The code for `fusio` is clear, concise, and easy to understand.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Violation of Submission Guidelines:** The problem statement explicitly mentions, "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means only the `fusio` function should be submitted. Your code includes `llegir_dades` and a `main` function, which are considered extraneous by the grading system.
    *   **Source of "Presentation Error":** The "Presentation Error" indicates that the output format generated by your `main` function does not match the expected format from the grader's perspective. Since the problem asks for a *function* and states the `main` program will be ignored, it's highly probable that the grader expects *no output at all* from your submission (as it only calls your `fusio` function internally). Your `main` function, however, prints `n1+n2` and then the merged list with a leading space (`print(" ", end="")`). This output is not part of the problem's requirements for the submitted function, hence the Presentation Error.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Adhere to Submission Instructions:** The most critical improvement is to **remove the `llegir_dades` and `main` functions entirely.** Your submission should consist solely of the `fusio` function. This will resolve the "Presentation Error" as no unexpected output will be produced.

    ```python
    # Only submit this part:
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else: # v2[i2] <= v1[i1]
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:]) # One of these will be an empty slice
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
