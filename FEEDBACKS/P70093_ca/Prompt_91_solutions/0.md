The problem asks for a function that merges two sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) into a single sorted list, without removing duplicate elements. The input lists are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

The provided Python code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through both lists simultaneously, comparing elements, and appending the smaller element to a result list. After one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining elements of the other list are appended.

**Code Strengths:**

*   **Core Logic:** The fundamental approach of iterating through both sorted lists and comparing elements is correct for merging sorted lists.
*   **Handling Remaining Elements:** The use of `v.extend(v1[i1:])` and `v.extend(v2[i2:])` correctly appends any remaining elements from either `v1` or `v2` after the main `while` loop finishes.

**Code Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

The primary issue lies within the comparison logic inside the `while` loop:

```python
        if v1[i1] <= v2[i1]:  # <-- Problem here
            v.append(v1[i1])
            i1 += 1
        else:
            v.append(v2[i2])
            i2 += 1
```

The condition `v1[i1] <= v2[i1]` is incorrect because it compares the element at index `i1` in `v1` with the element at index `i1` in `v2`. This will lead to an `IndexError` if `v1` is shorter than `v2` (or vice-versa) and also miscompares elements. The comparison should be between `v1[i1]` and `v2[i2]`, as these are the current elements being considered from each respective list.

**Suggested Improvement:**

Modify the conditional statement within the `while` loop to compare the current elements from both lists:

```python
        if v1[i1] <= v2[i2]: # Correct comparison
            v.append(v1[i1])
            i1 += 1
        else:
            v.append(v2[i2])
            i2 += 1
```

By making this change, the function will correctly merge the two sorted lists as required by the problem description.
