**Feedback: Fusió de taules (Merging Sorted Lists)**

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem requires implementing a function `fusio` that takes two already sorted lists (`v1` and `v2`) of floating-point numbers and merges them into a single sorted list. Duplicate elements should be preserved. For example, merging `[2, 3, 5]` and `[3, 5, 5, 7]` should result in `[2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7]`.

The provided Python code implements a classic two-pointer merge algorithm within the `fusio` function. It iterates through both input lists simultaneously, comparing elements at the current pointers (`i1` and `i2`). The smaller element is appended to a new `llista_definitiva` (final list), and its corresponding pointer is incremented. After one list is fully traversed, the remaining elements of the other list are appended to the `llista_definitiva`.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The `fusio` function correctly implements the efficient two-pointer merge algorithm. This approach ensures the resulting list is sorted and has a time complexity of O(N+M), where N and M are the lengths of the input lists, which is optimal for this problem.
    *   **Clear Logic:** The merging logic within `fusio` is straightforward and easy to understand.
    *   **Robustness:** The use of `extend` for remaining elements correctly handles cases where input lists have different lengths or one is empty.
    *   **Adherence to Function Interface:** The `fusio` function signature `fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]` matches the problem's specification for Python.

*   **Weaknesses & Cause of "Presentation Error":**
    *   **Unnecessary Main Program:** The problem statement explicitly says: "Només cal enviar el procediment demanat; el programa principal serà ignorat." This means only the `fusio` function itself should be submitted. The entire `main` function, along with `from yogi import read`, `llegir_dades`, and the `main()` call, constitutes a "main program" that should not be present in the submission. This is the direct cause of the "Presentation Error." The judging system expects *only* the function, not code that reads input or prints output.
    *   **Input Reading (if kept):** The `llegir_dades` function has a type hint `n:int)->list[int]` but reads `read(float)`. While reading `float` is correct for the problem, the type hint is inconsistent. (However, this function should be removed).
    *   **Output Formatting (if kept):** The `main` function's output `print(" ",end="")` followed by `print(*fusio(v1,v2))` might produce an undesirable leading space or other formatting issues if the problem had strict output requirements for a full program (which it doesn't, as only the function is expected).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Crucial Fix (for "Presentation Error"):** Remove the `from yogi import read` line, the `llegir_dades` function, the `main` function definition, and the `main()` call at the end. Your submission should consist *only* of the `fusio` function:

    ```python
    def fusio(v1: list[float], v2: list[float]) -> list[float]:
        i1 = 0
        i2 = 0
        llista_definitiva=[]
        while i1 < len(v1) and i2 < len(v2):
            if v1[i1] < v2[i2]:
                llista_definitiva.append(v1[i1])
                i1 += 1
            else:
                llista_definitiva.append(v2[i2])
                i2 += 1
        llista_definitiva.extend(v1[i1:])
        llista_definitiva.extend(v2[i2:])
        return llista_definitiva
    ```
2.  **Minor Refinement (if `llegir_dades` were to exist elsewhere):** If `llegir_dades` were intended for a different use case, its type hint should be corrected to `def llegir_dades(n: int) -> list[float]:`.

Your `fusio` function itself is a well-implemented solution to the problem. The "Presentation Error" is purely an issue with the submission format, not the core algorithm.
