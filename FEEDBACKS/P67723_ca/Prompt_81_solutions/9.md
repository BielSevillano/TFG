This program aims to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, `a` and `b`. The solution uses the Euclidean algorithm, a recursive approach where the GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of the smaller number and the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number. The base case for the recursion is when the second number (`b`) becomes zero, at which point the first number (`a`) is the GCD.

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The core logic implements the Euclidean algorithm correctly, which is an efficient and standard method for finding the GCD.
*   **Readability:** The code is concise and easy to understand. The function `gcd` clearly defines the recursive logic.
*   **Input Handling:** It correctly reads two integer inputs using `yogi.read(int)`.
*   **Output Formatting:** The output message is informative and follows the problem's requirements by stating "El mcd de [num1] i [num2] es [gcd_result]".

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Output Formatting (Minor):** The problem statement shows an example output with a period at the end: "El mcd de a i b es X." Your code does not include this final period. While this might not be the reason for a "Wrong Answer" in all judging systems, it's a minor detail that deviates from the implied output format. Many other example solutions *do* include this period.
*   **No Error Handling:** The problem statement specifies "dos naturals estrictament positius a i b". The code does not explicitly check if the inputs are positive. If non-positive numbers were provided, the behavior might be undefined or incorrect depending on the Python version and the specific values. However, for typical competitive programming platforms, it's often assumed that the input adheres to the problem constraints.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Add the trailing period to the output:** To perfectly match the example output format, you can add a period at the end of the `print` statement.

    ```python
    print("El mcd de", num1, "i", num2, "es", gcd(num1, num2), ".")
    ```
    Or, using an f-string:
    ```python
    print(f"El mcd de {num1} i {num2} es {gcd(num1, num2)}.")
    ```

2.  **Consider an iterative Euclidean Algorithm (Optional but common):** While the recursive version is perfectly fine and efficient, an iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm is also common and can sometimes be preferred to avoid potential stack overflow issues with extremely large inputs (though this is unlikely to be a concern for this specific problem given typical integer limits).

    Here's an iterative version:
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    def gcd_iterative(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    num1 = read(int)
    num2 = read(int)

    print(f"El mcd de {num1} i {num2} es {gcd_iterative(num1, num2)}.")
    ```

The "Wrong Answer" likely stems from the minor output formatting difference (the missing period) or potentially an edge case related to input constraints if the judging system is strict about them and your implementation of `yogi.read` handles them differently than expected. However, the algorithm itself is sound.
