Here's a feedback for your program:

## Feedback for "Màxim comú divisor" Program

**Problem Summary:**

The problem asks to write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive integers.

**Solution Approach:**

Your program implements a recursive approach to calculate the GCD, based on the Euclidean algorithm. The base case is when `b` is 0, in which case `a` is the GCD. Otherwise, it recursively calls `mcd` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`).

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** You have correctly implemented the Euclidean algorithm, which is a standard and efficient method for finding the GCD.
*   **Recursive Implementation:** The recursive nature of your `mcd` function is clean and directly reflects the mathematical definition of the algorithm.
*   **Readability:** The code is generally easy to read and understand. The variable names are clear, and the function signature is well-defined.
*   **Use of `yogis.read`:** You are correctly using the `yogis.read` function to handle input.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Output Format:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is likely the output format. The problem statement requires writing "El màxim comú divisor de a i b es X". Your current output is "El mcd de a i b es X", which is close but not exactly what's expected. Specifically, "mcd" is an abbreviation and the Catalan phrase is requested.
*   **Unnecessary Type Conversion in Print:** While not causing a "Wrong Answer," concatenating strings with `str(a)` and `str(b)` is a bit verbose. Python's f-strings or `.format()` method can make this cleaner.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Match the Exact Output Format:**
    *   Change `"El mcd de "` to `"El màxim comú divisor de "`.
    *   Change `" es "` to `" es "`.

    A more Pythonic way to achieve this would be using f-strings:

    ```python
    print(f"El màxim comú divisor de {a} i {b} es {mcd(a, b)}.")
    ```

    Or using the `.format()` method:

    ```python
    print("El màxim comú divisor de {} i {} es {}.".format(a, b, mcd(a, b)))
    ```

2.  **Consider Iterative Euclidean Algorithm (Optional but good to know):**
    While your recursive solution is perfectly valid and efficient enough for this problem, an iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm is also common and might be slightly more memory-efficient for very large inputs (though this is unlikely to be an issue here).

    Here's an example of an iterative version:

    ```python
    def mcd_iterative(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    ```
    You could then use this `mcd_iterative` function instead of the recursive `mcd`.

**In summary:** Your core logic for calculating the GCD is sound. The "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly due to a minor discrepancy in the output string. By adjusting the printed text to exactly match the problem's requirement, your program should pass.
