This feedback analyzes your Python program for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

**Feedback for your GCD program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks you to write a program that computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers. Your solution effectively tackles this by implementing the **Euclidean algorithm** using an iterative approach. This classic algorithm works by repeatedly taking the remainder of the division of the two numbers until one of them becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the GCD.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Algorithm:** The core logic accurately implements the Euclidean algorithm (`while y!=0: r = x % y; x = y; y = r`), which is the most efficient and widely accepted method for finding the GCD.
    *   **Readability:** The code is clean, concise, and easy to follow, making its purpose immediately clear.
    *   **Preservation of Original Inputs:** You correctly store the original input values (`x1`, `y1`) before performing calculations, allowing them to be used in the final print statement for a complete output message.
    *   **F-string for Output:** Using an f-string for printing (`print (f' El mcd de {x1} i {y1} es {x}.')`) is a modern and readable way to format output.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Presentation Error (Output Format):** The main reason for the "Presentation Error" is likely a small formatting inconsistency in your output string. Your `print` statement includes a leading space before "El mcd de...". Online judges are very strict about exact output matching. The expected output typically starts immediately with "El mcd de..." without any preceding whitespace.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format (Crucial for Presentation Error):**
    To resolve the "Presentation Error," simply remove the leading space in your f-string. The corrected line should look like this:
    ```python
    print(f'El mcd de {x1} i {y1} es {x}.')
    ```
    This ensures that the output starts precisely at the beginning of the line, matching the common expected format on platforms like Jutge.org.

2.  **Consider Using `math.gcd` for Brevity (Optional):**
    While your custom implementation of the Euclidean algorithm is excellent and often encouraged for learning purposes, Python's `math` module provides a built-in `gcd` function. If conciseness is prioritized and implementing the algorithm from scratch isn't a strict requirement, you could use it as follows:
    ```python
    from yogi import read
    from math import gcd

    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    result = gcd(a, b)
    print(f'El mcd de {a} i {b} es {result}.')
    ```
    However, your current approach perfectly aligns with the problem statement's hint that efficiency isn't the primary concern, and it demonstrates a solid understanding of the algorithm.

Your program is functionally correct and uses an optimal algorithm for the problem. The "Presentation Error" is a minor formatting detail that can be easily fixed.
