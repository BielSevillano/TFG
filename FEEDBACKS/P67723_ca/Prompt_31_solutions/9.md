This program aims to solve the problem of calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers.

### Summary of Problem and Solution Approach

The problem requires writing a program that reads two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and outputs their greatest common divisor. The provided solution implements the classic **Euclidean algorithm** iteratively. This algorithm efficiently finds the GCD by repeatedly replacing the pair of numbers `(a, b)` with `(b, a % b)` until `b` becomes 0. At that point, `a` holds the GCD.

### Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm Implementation:** The `mcd` function correctly implements the iterative Euclidean algorithm, which is a mathematically sound and highly efficient method for finding the GCD.
*   **Clear and Concise Logic:** The `while b: a, b = b, a % b` loop is a very elegant and common way to express the Euclidean algorithm in Python.
*   **Function Encapsulation:** The GCD logic is well-encapsulated within the `mcd(a, b)` function, promoting modularity and reusability.

**Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**

The "Wrong Answer" likely stems from an incompatibility with how input and output are handled in the Jutge.org environment, rather than a logical error in the GCD calculation itself.

1.  **Incorrect Input Reading for the Platform:**
    *   The program uses `a = int(input("Entra el primer nombre: "))` and `b = int(input("Entra el segon nombre: "))`. In competitive programming platforms like Jutge.org (indicated by `from jutge import read`), input is typically read from standard input without prompts. The `input()` function, when called with a prompt string, writes that string to standard output, which interferes with the judging system's expectation of clean output and input reading.
    *   The presence of `from jutge import read` strongly suggests that the platform expects input to be read using `read(int)` (or `jutge.read(int)`), not `input()`.

2.  **Output Format Mismatch:**
    *   Online judges are very strict about output format. The program prints `print("El mcd de", a, "i", b, "es", mcd(a, b))`. Many reference solutions (and typical judge expectations) include a period at the end of the output line (e.g., `El mcd de X i Y es Z.`). A missing period or subtle differences in spacing can lead to a "Wrong Answer" verdict.

### Suggestions for Improvement

To correct the "Wrong Answer" and make the program suitable for the Jutge.org platform:

1.  **Use the Platform's Input Function:** Replace `input()` with `read(int)` as intended by `from jutge import read`.

    ```python
    from jutge import read

    def mcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    # Corrected input reading
    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    # ... rest of the code
    ```

2.  **Ensure Exact Output Format:** Adjust the `print` statement to match the expected format precisely, typically ending with a period. Using an f-string is often the cleanest way to achieve this.

    ```python
    # ... (after correcting input)
    print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {mcd(a, b)}.")
    ```

By making these two changes, the program should correctly pass the tests on Jutge.org, as its core GCD logic is sound.
