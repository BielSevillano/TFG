The program aims to solve the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) problem by implementing a recursive version of the Euclidean algorithm. It reads two integers, calculates their GCD using the `mcd` function, and then prints the result in a specified format.

### Analysis of the Code

**Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Algorithm:** The core of the program, the `mcd` function, correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD. This algorithm is highly efficient (logarithmic time complexity) and mathematically sound.
2.  **Recursive Elegance:** The recursive definition of `mcd` (`mcd(b, a % b)`) is concise and a classic way to express the Euclidean algorithm, making the logic clear.
3.  **Type Hinting:** The function signature `def mcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:` includes type hints, which improves code readability and maintainability, allowing for static analysis tools to catch potential errors.
4.  **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads two integer inputs using `yogi.read`, which is standard for the Jutge.org platform.

**Weaknesses:**

1.  **Output Format (Primary Issue for "Wrong Answer"):** The most probable reason for the "Wrong Answer" result, despite the correct algorithm, is a mismatch in the output format. Many online judges require an exact string match, including punctuation. The problem description itself doesn't explicitly state a trailing period, but almost all reference solutions include one. Your current output string `print("El mcd de " + str(a) + " i " + str(b) + " es " + str(mcd(a, b)))` is missing this common trailing period.
2.  **String Concatenation Style (Minor):** While functional, using `+` for string concatenation can become verbose and less readable with many variables. Modern Python offers more elegant ways to format strings.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Correct the Output Format (Crucial):** To fix the "Wrong Answer," add a trailing period to the output string. This is the most common reason for correct logic failing on online judges due to strict output requirements.

    *   **Current:**
        ```python
        print("El mcd de " + str(a) + " i " + str(b) + " es " + str(mcd(a, b)))
        ```
    *   **Suggested:**
        ```python
        print("El mcd de " + str(a) + " i " + str(b) + " es " + str(mcd(a, b)) + ".")
        ```

2.  **Improve Output String Formatting (Style):** For better readability and conciseness, consider using an f-string (formatted string literal) or the `.format()` method.

    *   **Using f-string (Recommended):**
        ```python
        print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {mcd(a, b)}.")
        ```
    *   **Using `.format()`:**
        ```python
        print("El mcd de {} i {} es {}.".format(a, b, mcd(a, b)))
        ```

By implementing the suggested output format correction, your program should pass, as its underlying GCD calculation is robust and correct.
