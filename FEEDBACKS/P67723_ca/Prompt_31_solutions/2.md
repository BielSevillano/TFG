### Feedback for the GCD Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The output should follow a specific format: "El mcd de a i b es X." where `X` is the calculated GCD.

**Solution Approach:**
The program implements the Euclidean algorithm, a standard and efficient method for finding the GCD of two integers. It first reads the two input numbers. It then ensures that the variable `a` always holds the larger number by swapping `a` and `b` if `b` is initially greater than `a`. The core of the algorithm is a `while` loop that continues as long as `b` is not zero. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder `r = a % b`, then updates `a` to the previous `b`, and `b` to the remainder `r`. When `b` eventually becomes zero, `a` will hold the GCD.

**Code Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm Implementation:** The core logic for the Euclidean algorithm (`while (b!=0): r=a%b; a=b; b=r`) is correctly implemented and effectively calculates the GCD. This algorithm is efficient and appropriate for the problem constraints.
*   **Clarity:** The code's steps are generally clear, and the variable names (`a`, `b`, `r`) are conventional for this algorithm, making it relatively easy to understand.
*   **Input Handling:** It correctly reads integer inputs using `yogi.read`.

**Code Weaknesses:**
*   **Output Formatting Error:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is a subtle error in the output formatting. The program prints "El mcd de X i Y es" without a trailing space (due to `end=""`), and then immediately prints the GCD value followed by a period. This results in output like `El mcd de 10 i 5 es5.` instead of the expected `El mcd de 10 i 5 es 5.`. A space is missing between "es" and the GCD value.
*   **Unnecessary Initial Swap:** The `if (b>a): ...` block that swaps `a` and `b` to ensure `a` is initially greater than or equal to `b` is not strictly necessary for the iterative Euclidean algorithm implemented (i.e., `a, b = b, a % b`). The algorithm naturally handles cases where `b > a` in its first iteration by effectively swapping the numbers. While not a functional bug, removing it would make the code slightly more concise.
*   **Modifies Original Input Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` that store the initial input values are directly used in the GCD calculation loop and are modified. This is fine for the calculation, but if these original values were needed later, they would have to be stored in separate variables. In this specific `print` structure, `a` and `b` in the first print statement correctly refer to the initial inputs, as this statement is executed *before* the loop.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Correct Output Formatting:** The most crucial fix is to adjust the print statement to include the required space before the GCD value.
    One way to fix this while maintaining a similar structure:
    ```python
    from yogi import read
    original_a = read(int) # Store original values
    original_b = read(int)

    # Use working copies for the algorithm
    a = original_a
    b = original_b

    # Print the first part of the message with a trailing space
    print("El mcd de", original_a, "i", original_b, "es", end=" ")

    # The rest of your GCD algorithm
    if (b > a):
        a, b = b, a # Pythonic way to swap

    while (b != 0):
        r = a % b
        a = b
        b = r

    # Now print the calculated GCD and the period
    print(a, end=".\n") # 'a' now holds the GCD
    ```
    Alternatively, using f-strings or `.format()` is generally more robust for formatted output:
    ```python
    from yogi import read
    # ... (GCD calculation, storing initial a and b in original_a, original_b
    #      and the result in a, as in the example above) ...
    # print(f"El mcd de {original_a} i {original_b} es {a}.")
    ```

2.  **Utilize `math.gcd`:** For maximum simplicity and robustness in Python, consider using the built-in `math.gcd()` function from the `math` module. This vastly simplifies the code and avoids potential implementation errors:
    ```python
    from yogi import read
    from math import gcd

    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    result_gcd = gcd(a, b)
    print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {result_gcd}.")
    ```

3.  **Remove Unnecessary Swap:** The initial `if (b>a): ...` block can be removed. The Euclidean algorithm `a, b = b, a % b` works correctly regardless of whether `a` is initially greater than `b`.

By addressing the output formatting, the program should produce the correct answer and pass the test cases.
