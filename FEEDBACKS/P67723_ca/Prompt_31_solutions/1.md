### Feedback on GCD Program

**1. Summary of Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The provided solution correctly implements the **Euclidean algorithm** (also known as the "division algorithm"). This approach works by repeatedly replacing the larger of the two numbers with the remainder of the division of the two numbers until one of them becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the GCD.

**2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program accurately computes the GCD using a classic and proven algorithm. The "Accepted" status confirms its functional correctness.
    *   **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm is highly efficient, having a logarithmic time complexity. This aligns well with the problem's observation that the solution "no hauria de ser excessivament lenta."
    *   **Clarity:** The code is quite readable. The variable names (`a`, `b` for original inputs, `x`, `y` for iteration, `r` for remainder) are appropriately chosen, making it easy to follow the algorithm's steps.
    *   **Output Format:** The `f-string` used for printing the result (`El mcd de {a} i {b} es {x}.`) produces the output in the specified format, clearly presenting the result along with the original input numbers.
    *   **Docstring:** The inclusion of a multiline string (`""" donats dos nombres naturals retorna el màxim comú divisor d'entre ells dos. """`) serves as a helpful comment or docstring, explaining the program's purpose.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Modularity/Encapsulation:** The core logic for calculating the GCD is directly embedded in the main script body. While acceptable for a small script, for larger or more complex applications, encapsulating this logic within a dedicated function (e.g., `def gcd(a, b): ...`) would improve reusability and code organization.
    *   **Docstring Placement:** The docstring is placed globally in the script. If the logic were encapsulated in a function, the docstring would ideally be placed immediately after the function definition to properly document its purpose.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Encapsulate in a Function:** To improve modularity and reusability, consider defining a function for the GCD calculation. For example:

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    def calculate_gcd(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        """
        Donats dos nombres naturals, retorna el màxim comú divisor d'entre ells.
        Implementa l'algoritme d'Euclides.
        """
        x = num1
        y = num2
        while y > 0:
            r = x % y
            x = y
            y = r
        return x

    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    result = calculate_gcd(a, b)
    print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {result}.")
    ```

2.  **Leverage Standard Library (for practical use):** While the exercise likely aims for manual implementation, it's worth noting that Python's `math` module provides a highly optimized `gcd` function. For real-world applications where you don't need to implement the algorithm yourself, `from math import gcd` is the most straightforward and robust solution:

    ```python
    from yogi import read
    from math import gcd # Import the built-in GCD function

    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    result = gcd(a, b)
    print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {result}.")
    ```
    This alternative is often preferred in practice due to its efficiency and reliability, and many of the reference solutions demonstrate this approach.
