This program effectively solves the problem of calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers.

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks to compute the maximum common divisor of two strictly positive integers, `a` and `b`. The program implements the iterative Euclidean algorithm, which is a classic and highly efficient method for finding the GCD. The approach involves repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the GCD.

**2. Code Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The implementation of the Euclidean algorithm is accurate and will correctly compute the GCD for any valid positive integer inputs.
*   **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm is very efficient, especially for large numbers, fulfilling the problem's requirement that the solution "tampoc no hauria de ser excessivament lenta."
*   **Clear Output:** The use of an f-string for the final print statement provides a clear and user-friendly output, including the original input numbers.
*   **Standard Library Usage:** The program correctly uses `yogi.read(int)` for input as expected in the Jutge.org environment.

**3. Code Weaknesses:**
*   **Unused Variable:** The line `d = n` assigns a value to `d` but this variable is never used again, making it redundant.
*   **Variable Naming and Clarity:** While functional, the variable names `n` and `m` are used as working variables that change during the calculation, requiring `aux` and `aux1` to store the original input values for the final output string. This could be slightly clearer by either using more descriptive names for the working variables or encapsulating the GCD logic in a function.

**4. Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Remove Unused Variable:** Delete the line `d = n`.
2.  **Improve Variable Handling for Clarity:** Consider renaming variables to better distinguish between original inputs and working variables, or adopt a more Pythonic way of implementing the Euclidean algorithm directly. For instance:
    ```python
    import yogi

    original_a = yogi.read(int)
    original_b = yogi.read(int)

    a, b = original_a, original_b # Use separate variables for the algorithm

    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b # Pythonic way to update a and b

    print(f'El mcd de {original_a} i {original_b} es {a}.')
    ```
3.  **Encapsulate in a Function (Modularity):** For better code organization and reusability, especially in larger programs, it's good practice to wrap the GCD calculation in a dedicated function:
    ```python
    import yogi

    def calculate_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor using the Euclidean algorithm."""
        while b != 0:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    num1 = yogi.read(int)
    num2 = yogi.read(int)

    result_gcd = calculate_gcd(num1, num2)

    print(f'El mcd de {num1} i {num2} es {result_gcd}.')
    ```
    This approach makes the code more modular, readable, and easier to test or reuse.
