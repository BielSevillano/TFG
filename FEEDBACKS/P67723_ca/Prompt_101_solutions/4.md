## Feedback for the provided Python program to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

**Problem:** The problem asks to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive integers.

**Solution Approach:** The provided solution attempts to implement a recursive approach to find the GCD. It uses the Euclidean algorithm, where the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The base case for the recursion is when the remainder is 0, in which case the GCD is the divisor.

### Code Analysis:

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm Concept:** The core idea of using the Euclidean algorithm is correct and is a standard way to solve the GCD problem.
*   **Recursive Structure:** The intention to use recursion is evident.
*   **Clear Function Definition:** The `mcd_recursiu` function is defined with type hints, which is good practice.
*   **Input Handling:** The `main` function correctly reads two integers from the input.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Recursive Call and Return:** This is the primary reason for the "Wrong Answer". In the `else` block of `mcd_recursiu`, the recursive call `mcd_recursiu(divisor, r)` is made, but its return value is **not used or returned** by the current function call. This means the result of the recursive computation is lost, and the function will ultimately return `None` implicitly.
*   **Missing `return` Statement in `else`:** To fix the above, the recursive call needs to be followed by `return`.
*   **Redundant Import:** `from math import *` is imported, but only `max` and `min` are used from it. While not strictly an error, it's good practice to import only what is needed. `max` and `min` can be found in the built-in functions without needing a specific import.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1.  **Fix the Recursive Return:**
    Modify the `mcd_recursiu` function to correctly return the result of the recursive call:

    ```python
    def mcd_recursiu(a:int,b:int)->int:
        # No need for explicit divident/divisor variables if using directly
        r = a % b
        if r == 0:
            return b
        else:
            return mcd_recursiu(b, r) # Corrected: return the result of the recursive call
    ```

2.  **Simplify Input Ordering (Optional but Recommended):**
    The `main` function uses `max(a,b)` and `min(a,b)` to ensure the larger number is passed as the first argument to `mcd_recursiu`. This is a good practice. However, if you prefer, you can also ensure `a >= b` within `mcd_recursiu` itself, or rely on the fact that the Euclidean algorithm works correctly regardless of the initial order, as demonstrated by many of the reference solutions.

3.  **Consider Iterative Euclidean Algorithm (More Common and Often Simpler):**
    While recursion is a valid approach, the iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm is often more straightforward to implement and avoids potential recursion depth limits for very large numbers. Many of the reference solutions demonstrate this.

    Here's an example of the iterative approach:

    ```python
    def mcd_iteratiu(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    ```
    And then in `main`:
    ```python
    def main() -> None:
        a = read(int)
        b = read(int)
        mcd_val = mcd_iteratiu(a, b) # Or mcd_iteratiu(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        print("El mcd de ", a, " i ", b, " es ", mcd_val, " .", sep="")
    ```

4.  **Remove Unused Imports:**
    You can remove `from math import *` if you are not using any other functions from the `math` module. `max` and `min` are built-in.

**Example of Corrected Recursive `mcd_recursiu`:**

```python
from yogi import *
# No need for math import if only using built-in max/min or iterative approach

def mcd_recursiu(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Calcula el màxim comú divisor de dos nombres recursivament."""
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return mcd_recursiu(b, a % b)

def main() -> None:
    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    # The Euclidean algorithm works fine regardless of order,
    # but passing max/min can be clearer or adhere to specific implementations.
    # If mcd_recursiu is defined to handle any order:
    mcd_val = mcd_recursiu(a, b)
    print("El mcd de ", a, " i ", b, " es ", mcd_val, " .", sep="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By addressing the missing `return` statement in the recursive call, your program will correctly calculate and output the GCD.
