The problem asks to write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers.

The provided solution uses a recursive approach to calculate the GCD, implementing the Euclidean algorithm. This is a standard and generally efficient method for finding the GCD.

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The `gcd` function correctly implements the recursive Euclidean algorithm. The base case (`b == 0`) returns `a`, and the recursive step `gcd(b, a % b)` is the core of the algorithm.
*   **Readability:** The code is clean and easy to understand. The function name `gcd` is descriptive.
*   **Standard Library Usage:** It correctly uses `yogi.read` for input.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Output Formatting:** The most significant issue leading to a "Wrong Answer" is likely the output format. The problem statement implies a specific output format, and the provided code's `print` statement `print("El mcd de", num1,"i", num2,"es", gcd(num1, num2))` might not match the expected exact string. Looking at the reference solutions, the output should often end with a period (`.`) or use specific string formatting. For example, `print("El mcd de", num1,"i", num2,"es", gcd(num1, num2), ".")` would add the period.
*   **No explicit main function (minor):** While not strictly necessary for this small script, encapsulating the main logic within a `main()` function is good practice. Some of the reference solutions also do this.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust Output Formatting:**
    *   Ensure the output precisely matches the expected format. Based on the reference solutions, adding a period at the end is a common requirement. Modify the print statement to:
        ```python
        print("El mcd de", num1, "i", num2, "es", gcd(num1, num2), ".")
        ```
    *   Alternatively, using f-strings can sometimes be cleaner and more explicit:
        ```python
        print(f"El mcd de {num1} i {num2} es {gcd(num1, num2)}.")
        ```

2.  **Consider an iterative GCD (optional):** While the recursive solution is correct, an iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm is also very common and might be slightly preferred in some contexts to avoid potential recursion depth limits (though unlikely for typical GCD inputs). The iterative version looks like this:
    ```python
    def gcd_iterative(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    ```
    You would then call `gcd_iterative(num1, num2)` instead.

By addressing the output formatting, your program should correctly solve the problem.
