This program aims to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The chosen approach is the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient and standard method for solving this problem.

### Analysis of the Code

**Problem and Solution Approach Summary:**
The problem requires finding the maximum common divisor of two integers. The program correctly implements the iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm. It initializes two working variables, `d` and `g`, with the input values `x` and `y`. Then, in a `while` loop, it repeatedly replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division of the two numbers until the remainder (`g`) becomes zero. At this point, the other number (`d`) holds the GCD.

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm:** The code accurately implements the Euclidean algorithm, which is highly efficient for GCD calculation. Its time complexity is logarithmic, making it suitable even for large numbers.
*   **Concise:** The implementation of the Euclidean algorithm is brief and straightforward.
*   **Readability:** The variable names, while short, are standard for this algorithm (`d` for divisor, `g` for dividend/remainder, `r` for remainder). The logic is easy to follow for anyone familiar with the algorithm.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **"Invalid Character" Error:** The primary issue reported is "Invalid Character". This error almost certainly points to the use of an f-string (`f'...'`) in the `print` statement (`print(f'el mcd de {x} i {y} és {d}')`). F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6. If the execution environment (common in online judges like `Jutge.org`) is running an older version of Python (e.g., 3.5 or earlier), this syntax is not recognized, leading to a syntax error.
*   **Output Format Mismatch (Potential):** While the problem description doesn't explicitly dictate the output string, `Jutge.org` typically requires very precise output matching.
    *   Your code prints `el mcd de ... és ...`.
    *   Many of the reference solutions (and common `Jutge.org` expectations) use `El mcd de ... es ... .` (note the capital 'E', the unaccented 'es', and often a period at the end).
    *   Even the character `é` in `és` could potentially contribute to an "invalid character" error if the file encoding is not correctly interpreted by the judge system, though the f-string syntax error is a more probable cause. This mismatch can lead to a "Wrong Answer" verdict, even if the computed GCD is correct.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Address the "Invalid Character" Error (Critical):**
    To ensure compatibility with a wider range of Python 3 environments, particularly older ones, modify the `print` statement to use an older string formatting method.
    *   **Using `str.format()` (Recommended for modern Python < 3.6):**
        ```python
        print('El mcd de {} i {} es {}.'.format(x, y, d))
        ```
    *   **Using string concatenation (Most compatible):**
        ```python
        print('El mcd de ' + str(x) + ' i ' + str(y) + ' es ' + str(d) + '.')
        ```

2.  **Standardize Output Format:**
    Align the output message with the common `Jutge.org` style and the examples provided by other solutions. This involves capitalizing "El", changing "és" to "es", and adding a period at the end. The suggested `str.format()` example above already incorporates these changes.

3.  **Variable Naming (Minor):**
    The use of `x` and `y` for original inputs and `d` and `g` for working variables is acceptable. Alternatively, you could store `x` and `y` in temporary variables (`a` and `b`) to perform the algorithm and use the original `x` and `y` for printing, as shown in some reference solutions:
    ```python
    from yogi import read

    original_x = read(int)
    original_y = read(int)

    a = original_x
    b = original_y

    while b != 0:
        remainder = a % b
        a = b
        b = remainder
    
    # Use original_x, original_y for printing
    print('El mcd de {} i {} es {}.'.format(original_x, original_y, a))
    ```
    However, your current approach of `d=x`, `g=y` and then using `x`, `y` in the print is also fine as `x` and `y` are not modified in the loop.

By implementing these suggestions, especially the change to the `print` statement, the program should run without the "Invalid Character" error and likely pass output format checks.
