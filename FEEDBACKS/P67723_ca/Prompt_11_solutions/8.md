### Feedback for the Màxim comú divisor program

**Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The provided solution implements the classic Euclidean algorithm recursively. This algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the pair `(a, b)` with `(b, a % b)` until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` is the GCD.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Algorithm:** The core logic `gcd(b, a % b)` is a perfect implementation of the Euclidean algorithm, which is mathematically sound and guaranteed to find the GCD.
2.  **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm is highly efficient, with a time complexity that is logarithmic to the input numbers. This easily satisfies the problem's observation that the solution "tampoc no hauria de ser excessivament lenta."
3.  **Readability and Conciseness:** The recursive implementation of `gcd` is very elegant and easy to understand, directly reflecting the mathematical definition of the algorithm.
4.  **Appropriate Input Handling:** Using `yogi.read(int)` is the standard way to handle input on the Jutge.org platform.

**Weaknesses:**

1.  **Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer": Output Formatting.** The most probable reason for receiving a "Wrong Answer" is a subtle issue with the output format. Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas, automatically inserts a space between each argument by default.
    The line `print("El mcd de", a,"i", b,"es", gcd(a, b),".")` will produce an output like:
    `El mcd de 10 i 15 es 5 .` (notice the extra space before the final period).
    Most online judges expect the output to be exact, meaning there should be no space between the GCD value and the final period, e.g., `El mcd de 10 i 15 es 5.`. This is a very common source of "Wrong Answer" errors on programming contests.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The core logic of your `gcd` function is excellent and does not need improvement. The primary suggestion is to fix the output formatting. Here are a few ways to achieve the correct output:

1.  **Using f-strings (Recommended):** This is the most modern and readable way to format strings in Python.
    ```python
    print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {gcd(a, b)}.")
    ```
    This ensures that the period immediately follows the calculated GCD value.

2.  **Using `str.format()`:** Another very common and powerful way to format strings.
    ```python
    print("El mcd de {} i {} es {}.".format(a, b, gcd(a, b)))
    ```

3.  **Controlling the `sep` argument in `print()`:** You can explicitly set the separator for `print()` arguments.
    ```python
    print("El mcd de ", a, " i ", b, " es ", gcd(a, b), ".", sep="")
    ```
    Note that this approach requires you to explicitly manage spaces as part of the string literals (`"El mcd de "`, `" i "`, etc.) or it will merge everything without spaces. A more precise modification would be:
    ```python
    print("El mcd de ", a, " i ", b, " es ", gcd(a, b), ".", sep="") # This still has an issue if not careful
    ```
    A better way using `sep` would be to concatenate the parts that need to be together first:
    ```python
    print("El mcd de " + str(a) + " i " + str(b) + " es " + str(gcd(a, b)) + ".")
    ```
    However, the f-string or `.format()` methods are generally cleaner for this specific output pattern.

By correcting the output formatting, your program should pass the tests and achieve an "Accepted" status, as its underlying algorithm is robust and correct for the problem description.
