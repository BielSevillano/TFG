### Feedback on the Maximum Common Divisor (MCD) Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The output should display the calculated GCD. The efficiency requirement states that the solution doesn't need to be extremely fast but shouldn't be excessively slow.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program implements the iterative **Euclidean algorithm** to find the GCD. It first reads two integers, `a` and `b`, and stores their original values in `d` and `e` for later printing. It then ensures that `a` is greater than or equal to `b` by swapping them if necessary. The core of the algorithm is a `while` loop that repeatedly calculates the remainder (`r = a % b`), then updates `a` to `b` and `b` to `r`, continuing until `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` holds the GCD. Finally, it prints the GCD along with the original input numbers.

**Code's Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Algorithm:** The program correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm, which is the standard, most efficient, and mathematically sound method for finding the GCD of two numbers.
2.  **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm has a logarithmic time complexity, making it very efficient even for large numbers. This fully satisfies the "not excessively slow" observation in the problem description.
3.  **Clarity:** The variable names (`a`, `b`, `r` for remainder, `d`, `e` for original values) are appropriate and contribute to the readability of the code.
4.  **Original Value Preservation:** Storing the initial `a` and `b` in `d` and `e` before the algorithm modifies them is good practice, allowing the final output string to reference the original input numbers.

**Code's Weaknesses:**

1.  **Presentation Error (Main Issue):** The program received a "Presentation Error," which almost always indicates a mismatch in the output format compared to what the automated judge expects.
    *   **Capitalization:** The most likely cause is the capitalization of "el mcd" in the `print` statement. Most Jutge.org problems expect "El mcd" (starting with an uppercase 'E'), whereas your code prints "el mcd" (lowercase 'e').
    *   **Subtle Spacing:** While `end="."` correctly prevents an extra space before the final period, other minor discrepancies in spacing (e.g., around the "i") could potentially contribute, though the capitalization is the primary suspect.

2.  **Unnecessary Initial Swap (Minor):** The `if (b > a): ...` block that ensures `a >= b` before entering the `while` loop is not strictly necessary for the Euclidean algorithm's correctness. If `a < b` initially, the first iteration (`r = a % b`) would simply result in `r = a`, and then `a` would become `b` and `b` would become `a`, effectively performing the swap implicitly. Removing this block would make the code slightly more concise without affecting correctness or efficiency.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output Format (Crucial):**
    *   Change `"el mcd"` to `"El mcd"` in your `print` statement.
    *   To ensure precise output formatting and avoid potential spacing issues, it's often best to use an f-string or `str.format()`.

    **Example of improved print statement:**
    ```python
    print(f"El mcd de {d} i {e} es {a}.")
    ```
    This ensures "El" is capitalized and the period directly follows the number `a` without an intervening space.

2.  **Remove Redundant Swap (Optional for conciseness):**
    You can remove the initial `if (b > a): ...` block. The Euclidean algorithm will work correctly regardless of the initial order of `a` and `b`. The first iteration would naturally put the larger number in `a` and the smaller (or remainder) in `b`.

3.  **Consider `math.gcd` for General Use (If allowed):**
    While the problem likely expects an implementation of the algorithm, for real-world scenarios or if not specifically prohibited, Python's built-in `math.gcd(a, b)` function provides the most concise and optimized way to calculate GCD. For instance:
    ```python
    from yogi import read
    import math

    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    result = math.gcd(a, b)
    print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {result}.")
    ```
    However, for this specific exercise, demonstrating your understanding of the algorithm through implementation (as you did) is generally preferred.
