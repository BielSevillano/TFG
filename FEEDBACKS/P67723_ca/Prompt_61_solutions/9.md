This feedback addresses a Python program designed to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

**Problem Description:**

The problem requires a program to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, denoted as 'a' and 'b'. The output should be the calculated GCD. The problem statement also notes that while extreme efficiency isn't mandatory, the solution shouldn't be excessively slow.

**Solution Approach:**

The provided program implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. This algorithm is a well-established and efficient method for this task. It iteratively replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number, until the remainder becomes zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The program correctly uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an excellent choice for calculating the GCD and meets the efficiency requirement.
*   **Clear Function Definition:** The `mcd` function is well-defined with clear input types (`int`) and a return type (`int`). The docstring explains the function's purpose.
*   **Readability:** The code is generally easy to read and understand.
*   **Modern Output Formatting:** The use of f-strings for output is good practice.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **"Wrong Answer" - Input/Output Mismatch (Most Likely Cause):** The primary reason for a "Wrong Answer" in competitive programming platforms like Jutge.org is often an exact mismatch in the output format. While your code prints "El mcd de {a} y {b} es {mcd(a, b)}.", the sample solutions and the problem statement often expect a very specific phrasing and punctuation.

    Looking at the provided reference solutions, common variations in output include:
    *   "El mcd de X i Y es Z." (using "i" instead of "y" for "and")
    *   Variations in spacing and the placement of the final period.

    The use of "y" in your output string "El mcd de {a} y {b} es {mcd(a, b)}." is likely the issue, as the problem is presented in Catalan, and "i" is the Catalan word for "and".

*   **Global Variable Usage:** While not strictly a "weakness" that would cause a "Wrong Answer" for this specific problem, it's generally good practice to avoid modifying global variables within functions if possible, or at least be aware of it. In your `mcd` function, the `a` and `b` parameters are modified, which is fine within the function's scope. However, the `a` and `b` read from `yogi.read(int)` are global. While this doesn't cause an error here, it can lead to confusion in larger programs.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output Formatting:** This is the most critical change needed to resolve the "Wrong Answer".
    *   Change `"El mcd de {a} y {b} es {mcd(a, b)}."` to `"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {mcd(a, b)}."`.
    *   Carefully check for any other subtle formatting differences (e.g., extra spaces, missing periods) against the expected output format of the judge system.

2.  **Consider Function Scope (Minor Improvement):**
    While not essential for this problem, you could pass the read values `a` and `b` as arguments to the `mcd` function when calling it, to make it explicitly clear that the function operates on copies of those values:

    ```python
    import yogi

    def mcd(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        """Calcula el mcd de dos nombres a través de l'algoritme d'Euclides"""
        while num2:
            num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2
        return num1

    a_val = yogi.read(int)
    b_val = yogi.read(int)

    print(f'El mcd de {a_val} i {b_val} es {mcd(a_val, b_val)}.')
    ```
    This change makes the `mcd` function entirely self-contained and less dependent on global variables.

3.  **Explore Recursive Euclidean Algorithm (Alternative):**
    Although your iterative approach is perfectly fine and efficient, you could also implement the Euclidean algorithm recursively. This is demonstrated in some of the reference solutions and can be a good learning exercise.

**Example of corrected output statement:**

```python
print(f'El mcd de {a} i {b} es {mcd(a, b)}.')
```

By addressing the output format, particularly the use of "i" instead of "y", the program should correctly pass the tests.
