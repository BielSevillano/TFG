The problem asks to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive integers. The provided solution uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a standard and efficient method for finding the GCD.

**Code Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The code correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm. It iteratively uses the modulo operator to find the remainder, and then replaces the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder. This process continues until the remainder is zero, at which point the GCD is the last non-zero remainder.
*   **Concise Implementation:** The use of a `while` loop and variable reassignment makes the implementation very concise and readable for someone familiar with the Euclidean algorithm.
*   **Handles Input:** It correctly reads two integer inputs using `from yogi import read`.

**Code Weaknesses:**

*   **No Output Formatting:** The problem statement doesn't explicitly require specific output formatting, but the provided solution only prints the calculated GCD without any descriptive text. Many of the reference solutions include output like "El mcd de X i Y es Z." This might be why it's marked as "Wrong Answer" by the judge if it expects a specific output format.
*   **Potential for Infinite Loop (Theoretically):** While the problem states strictly positive integers, if `y` were initially 0 (which is ruled out by the problem statement), the `while y != 0:` loop would not execute, and `x` would be printed. However, for the given constraints (strictly positive integers), this is not an issue.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

The primary improvement needed is to match the expected output format. Based on the problem description and the reference solutions, it's highly probable that the output needs to be more descriptive.

1.  **Add Descriptive Output:** Modify the `print` statement to include the original input numbers and a clear message.

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    x_orig = read(int) # Store original values for output
    y_orig = read(int)

    x = x_orig
    y = y_orig

    while y != 0:
        r = x % y
        x = y
        y = r

    print(f"El mcd de {x_orig} i {y_orig} es {x}.")
    ```

    Alternatively, you could use `.format()`:

    ```python
    from yogi import read

    x_orig = read(int)
    y_orig = read(int)

    x = x_orig
    y = y_orig

    while y != 0:
        r = x % y
        x = y
        y = r

    print("El mcd de {} i {} es {}.".format(x_orig, y_orig, x))
    ```

By adding the descriptive output, the program should align with the expected behavior and likely pass the "Wrong Answer" test case. The core logic of the Euclidean algorithm is sound and efficient for this problem.
