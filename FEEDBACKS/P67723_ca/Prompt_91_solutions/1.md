This feedback is for the provided Python program that aims to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

**Problem Description:**

The task is to write a program that takes two strictly positive integers as input and outputs their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The solution should be reasonably efficient but doesn't need to be overly optimized.

**Solution Approach:**

The provided code implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD. This algorithm is a standard and efficient method for this problem. It works by repeatedly applying the modulo operation until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Algorithm:** The code correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm. The logic of repeatedly calculating the remainder and updating the numbers is sound for finding the GCD.
*   **Readability:** The variable names (`x1`, `y1`, `x`, `y`, `r`) are reasonably clear, and the loop structure is easy to follow.
*   **Handles Input:** It correctly reads two integers from the input using `yogi.read(int)`.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Output Formatting:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is likely the output format. The problem statement implies a specific output format, and the current code prints " El mcd de {x1} i {y1} es {x}" without a trailing period. Many of the example solutions include a period at the end of the output.
*   **Variable Naming for Original Values:** While `x1` and `y1` are used to store the original input values, the loop modifies `x` and `y`. The final output correctly uses `x1` and `y1`, but it's worth noting that the original input values are preserved.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Output Formatting:**
    *   **Add a period at the end of the output string.** Based on the example solutions, the expected output typically includes a period. You can achieve this by modifying the `print` statement:
        ```python
        print(f'El mcd de {x1} i {y1} es {x}.')
        ```
    *   Consider removing the leading space in the output string for a cleaner look, although this might not be the cause of the "Wrong Answer."

2.  **Variable Naming (Minor Improvement):**
    *   While not strictly necessary for correctness, you could consider slightly more descriptive variable names if you were to refactor. For example, `num1`, `num2` for the original inputs and `current_a`, `current_b` for the numbers being processed in the loop. However, `x` and `y` are common conventions for the Euclidean algorithm.

**Example of Corrected Output:**

If the input is `12 18`, the current output is:
` El mcd de 12 i 18 es 6`

With the suggested change, the output would become:
`El mcd de 12 i 18 es 6.`

By addressing the output formatting, your program should pass the tests. The core logic of the Euclidean algorithm is already well-implemented.
