This program effectively solves the problem of calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a program that computes the Maximum Common Divisor (Màxim Comú Divisor or MCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The program successfully addresses this by implementing the **Euclidean Algorithm**, which is a highly efficient method for finding the GCD. The algorithm works by iteratively replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger by the smaller number, until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the GCD.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program accurately implements the Euclidean Algorithm, a mathematically proven method for GCD calculation. Its "Accepted" status confirms its correctness against test cases.
*   **Efficiency:** The Euclidean Algorithm is renowned for its efficiency and rapid convergence, even with large input numbers. This aligns perfectly with the problem's observation that the solution "no hauria de ser excessivament lenta."
*   **Readability:** The code is clear and relatively easy to follow, especially for those familiar with the Euclidean Algorithm. The variable names `a`, `b`, and `r` are standard in this context.
*   **Output Format:** The program generates output that precisely matches the specified format: "El mcd de [original a] i [original b] es [GCD result]."
*   **Original Values Preservation:** The program correctly preserves the initial input values (`d` and `c`) to display them in the final output message.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Redundant Variables for Output:** The introduction of variables `c` and `d` solely to store the original input values (`b` and `a` respectively) for the print statement is functional but slightly redundant. The same result can be achieved with more concise methods.
*   **Minor Variable Naming:** While `a` and `b` are appropriate for the algorithm's operands, `c` and `d` are not very descriptive as "original_b" and "original_a". Using more explicit names could enhance clarity for a reader unfamiliar with the implementation detail.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Streamline Output Printing with f-strings:** Instead of creating separate variables `c` and `d` to store original inputs, you can assign the initial values to temporary variables (`original_a`, `original_b`) and then use an f-string for a cleaner and more readable print statement.

    ```python
    import yogi

    # Read inputs and store their original values
    original_a = yogi.read(int)
    original_b = yogi.read(int)

    # Use copies for the Euclidean algorithm
    a = original_a
    b = original_b

    while b > 0:
        r = a % b
        a = b
        b = r
            
    # Print using the original values and the calculated GCD
    print(f"El mcd de {original_a} i {original_b} es {a}.")
    ```

2.  **Concise Euclidean Algorithm using Tuple Unpacking:** Python allows for a very compact implementation of the Euclidean Algorithm using tuple unpacking, which can reduce the number of lines and temporary variables within the loop.

    ```python
    import yogi

    original_a = yogi.read(int)
    original_b = yogi.read(int)

    a, b = original_a, original_b # Use copies for the algorithm

    while b: # 'while b' is equivalent to 'while b > 0' for positive integers
        a, b = b, a % b # Simultaneously update a and b
            
    print(f"El mcd de {original_a} i {original_b} es {a}.")
    ```

These suggestions primarily focus on minor stylistic enhancements and code conciseness, as the core logic and efficiency of your current solution are excellent.
