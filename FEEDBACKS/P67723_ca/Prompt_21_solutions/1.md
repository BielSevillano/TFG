**Feedback for your "Màxim comú divisor" program**

Your program aims to solve the problem of calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that computes the Maximum Common Divisor (MCD) of two given strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. Your program correctly implements the **Euclidean algorithm** (also known as Euclid's algorithm) to find the GCD. This algorithm is an efficient method for computing the GCD, based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number, or more commonly, by its remainder when divided by the smaller number. The process continues until one of the numbers becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Algorithm Correctness:** The `mcd` function correctly implements the iterative version of the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm is mathematically sound for finding the GCD.
    *   **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm is very efficient, especially for large numbers, as it converges quickly. This aligns well with the observation in the problem description about efficiency.
    *   **Readability and Modularity:** The code is clean, concise, and uses a dedicated function `mcd(a, b)` which improves modularity and makes the code easy to understand.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Input Method (Critical Issue):** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly the way the program reads input. On platforms like Jutge.org, input is typically provided non-interactively through standard input (e.g., redirected from a file or piped). Your code uses `input("Entra el primer nombre: ")`, which is designed for interactive console input where a prompt is displayed to the user. The `from jutge import read` statement suggests you *should* be using `read()` from the `jutge` module to fetch input from the platform. Since the platform doesn't display prompts or wait for interactive input, using `input()` will lead to incorrect behavior or a timeout.
    *   **Output Formatting (Minor Issue):** While the core logic for calculating the MCD is correct, the exact output format might also differ slightly from what the platform expects. For example, some common output requirements include a period at the end of the sentence (`.`) and specific spacing. Your `print("El mcd de", a, "i", b, "es", mcd(a, b))` statement might not precisely match the expected output string, especially regarding the final punctuation.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Input Method (Crucial):** Replace the `input()` calls with `read()` from the `jutge` module. This is the most important change to resolve the "Wrong Answer".
    *   Change:
        ```python
        # a = int(input("Entra el primer nombre: "))
        # b = int(input("Entra el segon nombre: "))
        a = read(int)
        b = read(int)
        ```
2.  **Refine Output Formatting (Recommended):** To ensure your output exactly matches the platform's expectations, use an f-string or `str.format()` for precise control over the output string, including any required punctuation. Based on the C++ reference solution and common Jutge.org practices, a period at the end is usually expected.
    *   Change:
        ```python
        # print("El mcd de", a, "i", b, "es", mcd(a, b))
        print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {mcd(a, b)}.")
        ```

By implementing these changes, especially the correct input method, your program should pass the tests on Jutge.org. The core logic of your GCD function is robust and well-implemented.
