**Feedback for your GCD program**

**Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a program to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive integers, `a` and `b`. Your program correctly identifies the need for the Euclidean algorithm and implements its efficient modulo-based version. This algorithm iteratively replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division between the two numbers until one of them becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Algorithm Choice:** Implementing the Euclidean algorithm using the modulo operator (`%`) is an excellent and efficient approach for calculating the GCD.
*   **Core Algorithm Logic:** The `while b != 0:` loop and the assignments `r=a%b`, `a=b`, `b=r` correctly represent the steps of the Euclidean algorithm. Upon loop termination, the variable `a` (which has been modified during the process) correctly holds the GCD.
*   **Original Value Preservation:** You wisely store the initial input values in `m` and `n` (`m=a`, `n=b`) before modifying `a` and `b` in the algorithm. This allows the final print statement to display the original numbers along with their GCD.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Redundant Input Reading (Critical Error):** The most significant issue causing the "Wrong Answer" is the duplicate reading of input at the beginning of your program:
    ```python
    a = read(int)
    b = read(int)
    a = read(int) # This line is redundant
    b = read(int) # This line is redundant
    ```
    This causes the program to attempt to read four integers from the input, when only two are provided by the testing system. This will lead to an `EOFError` (End Of File Error) or similar issue, or potentially assign incorrect values if the `read` function defaults to a value or re-reads in an unexpected way, thereby failing the test case.
*   **Output Language Inconsistency:** The problem description is in Catalan, and typical platform expectations (as observed in other solutions) suggest the output message should also be in Catalan. Your current output `The gcd of ... is ... .` is in English.
*   **Comment Style:** While comments are present, some are quite conversational (e.g., `#si restem un numero multiples vegades fins que quedi el residu, calculem directament el residu`) and could be more concise or directly linked to the specific line of code they explain.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Remove Redundant Input Lines:** This is crucial. Delete the second pair of `a = read(int)` and `b = read(int)` lines. Your program only needs to read the two input integers once.
    ```python
    from yogi import *

    a = read(int) # Reads the first number
    b = read(int) # Reads the second number
    m = a         # Stores the original value of a
    n = b         # Stores the original value of b
    # ... rest of your correct algorithm ...
    ```
2.  **Translate Output Message to Catalan:** Modify your `print` statement to use Catalan for consistency with the problem statement:
    ```python
    print('El mcd de ', m, ' i ', n, ' es ', a, '.', sep='')
    ```
3.  **Refine Comments (Optional):** Consider making comments more direct and technical to explain the code's purpose. For example:
    ```python
    # Euclidean algorithm (modulo version)
    # Loop continues as long as b is not zero
    while b != 0:
        r = a % b   # Calculate the remainder
        a = b       # Update 'a' with the previous value of 'b'
        b = r       # Update 'b' with the remainder
    ```

By implementing these suggestions, particularly by fixing the input reading, your program will correctly solve the problem and produce the expected output, leading to a "Correct Answer". Your core algorithm for GCD calculation is already well-implemented.
