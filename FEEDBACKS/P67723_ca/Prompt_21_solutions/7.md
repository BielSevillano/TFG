Here's a feedback text for the provided program:

### Feedback: Màxim comú divisor

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The provided solution attempts to solve this by implementing the Euclidean algorithm recursively. It reads two integers, ensures the larger number is passed as the first argument to the recursive `mcd_recursiu` function, and then prints the calculated GCD.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Algorithm Choice:** The program correctly uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient and standard method for calculating the GCD.
    *   **Recursive Implementation:** It demonstrates an understanding of recursion by implementing the algorithm in a recursive manner.
    *   **Input Handling:** It uses `yogi.read` for input, which is appropriate for the typical competitive programming environment.
    *   **Argument Ordering:** The `max(a,b)` and `min(a,b)` calls ensure that `a` is always greater than or equal to `b` when `mcd_recursiu` is first called, which can simplify some Euclidean algorithm implementations (though not strictly necessary for its correctness in all forms).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Critical Bug (Missing `return` statement):** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict lies within the `mcd_recursiu` function. In the `else` branch (when `r != 0`), the recursive call `mcd_recursiu(divisor, r)` is made, but its return value is not explicitly returned by the current function call. In Python, a function implicitly returns `None` if it reaches the end of its execution without an explicit `return` statement. This means that if `r` is not 0 on the first recursive call, `mcd` in the `main` function will be assigned `None`, leading to an incorrect output.
    *   **Minor Output Formatting:** The output `print("El mcd de ",a," i ",b," es ",mcd," .", sep="")` with `sep=""` and the literal string ` " ."` results in an extra space before the final period (e.g., "es 6 .") instead of the more conventional "es 6.". While minor, some online judges are strict about exact output format.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Fix the Missing `return`:** This is the most crucial fix. Add `return` before the recursive call in the `else` branch of `mcd_recursiu`:
    ```python
    def mcd_recursiu(a:int,b:int)->int:
        divident=a
        divisor=b
        r=divident%divisor
        if r == 0:
            return divisor
        else:
            return mcd_recursiu(divisor,r) # <-- Add 'return' here
    ```

2.  **Refine Output Formatting:** To ensure the output matches the typical strict format, consider using an f-string:
    ```python
    def main()->None:
        a=read(int)
        b=read(int)
        mcd_val = mcd_recursiu(max(a,b),min(a,b)) # Renamed variable to avoid confusion with function name
        print(f"El mcd de {a} i {b} es {mcd_val}.")
    ```
    This will produce output like "El mcd de 6 i 9 es 3." without the extra space before the final dot.

By implementing these suggestions, particularly the first one, the program should correctly calculate and output the GCD for given inputs.
