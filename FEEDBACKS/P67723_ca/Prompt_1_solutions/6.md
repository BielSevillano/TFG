### Feedback for Máxim Comú Divisor Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks to write a program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The output should be the calculated GCD.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program correctly implements the **Euclidean algorithm** iteratively. This classic algorithm finds the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly applying the property that `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)` until one of the numbers (the remainder `b`) becomes zero. At that point, the other number (`a`) is the GCD.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Algorithmic Correctness:** The core logic precisely follows the iterative form of the Euclidean algorithm, which is a mathematically sound and highly efficient method for GCD calculation.
    *   **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm is very efficient, typically completing in a logarithmic number of steps relative to the input numbers, making it suitable even for large inputs (though the problem notes efficiency isn't strictly required, it's a good practice).
    *   **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is very compact and easy to understand, directly translating the algorithm's steps into Python.
    *   **Robustness to Input Order:** The iterative approach correctly handles cases where `a < b` or `a > b` without needing an initial swap, as the first iteration naturally reorders them effectively (`a` becomes `b`, and `b` becomes `a % b`).

*   **Weaknesses / Potential Reasons for "Wrong Answer":**
    *   **The "Wrong Answer" is puzzling given the correctness of the Euclidean algorithm.** The implementation is standard and should work for all strictly positive integers.
    *   **Output Format Sensitivity (Most Likely Culprit):** While the problem statement "Cal escriure el màxim comú divisor de a i b" typically implies printing *only* the numerical value, some online judges can be extremely strict about output format. If the judge unexpectedly requires additional text (like the full sentence shown in the C++ reference solution's `main` function: "El mcd de ..."), then printing just the number would result in a "Wrong Answer". However, based purely on the problem text, `print(a)` is the correct output format.
    *   **`yogi.read` Behavior:** While unlikely for standard integer inputs, if there's any peculiar behavior with the `yogi.read(int)` function for specific edge cases or input formats that are not strictly two distinct integer lines, it *could* potentially lead to incorrect input parsing. This is generally rare for basic integer reads.
    *   **No Explicit Input Validation:** The problem statement guarantees strictly positive inputs, so explicit validation isn't strictly necessary. However, in a general-purpose program, adding checks for positive integers would make it more robust.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Verify Output Format:** The most critical step is to confirm the exact output format expected by the judging system. If the judge indeed expects more than just the numerical GCD (e.g., a specific sentence or formatting), modify the `print` statement accordingly. If *only* the number is expected, the current `print(a)` is correct.
2.  **Test with Edge Cases:** Although the algorithm is robust, it's always good to manually test with various inputs, including:
    *   `gcd(1, N)` and `gcd(N, 1)` (e.g., `gcd(1, 5)`)
    *   `gcd(N, N)` (e.g., `gcd(7, 7)`)
    *   `gcd(prime, other_prime)` (e.g., `gcd(7, 5)`)
    *   `gcd(multiple, factor)` (e.g., `gcd(10, 2)`)
    The provided code should correctly handle all these.
3.  **Add Comments (Optional):** For clarity, especially in a learning context, a brief comment explaining that the code implements the Euclidean algorithm could be helpful, although for such a standard algorithm, it's often omitted in competitive programming.

Given the algorithm's correctness, the "Wrong Answer" most likely points to a discrepancy in output formatting or a very specific edge case that wasn't considered, rather than a flaw in the GCD logic itself.
