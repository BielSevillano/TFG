### Feedback on "Màxim comú divisor" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two strictly positive natural numbers, `a` and `b`. The provided Python program effectively solves this problem by implementing the classic Euclidean algorithm using a recursive function `mcd(a, b)`. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the GCD.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The implementation of the Euclidean algorithm is mathematically sound and correctly computes the GCD for all valid inputs.
*   **Efficiency:** The Euclidean algorithm is renowned for its efficiency, having a logarithmic time complexity relative to the input numbers. This perfectly addresses the problem's observation that the solution "no hauria de ser excessivament lenta."
*   **Readability and Conciseness:** The recursive approach is elegant, concise, and easy to understand for anyone familiar with the Euclidean algorithm. It clearly expresses the mathematical definition.
*   **Robustness to Input Order:** The algorithm handles cases where `a < b` correctly without needing an explicit swap. The first recursive call `mcd(b, a % b)` will naturally swap the arguments effectively (`mcd(b, a)` since `a % b == a` when `a < b`), ensuring the algorithm proceeds as expected.
*   **Adherence to Problem Requirements:** The program correctly uses `yogi.read` for input and outputs the result in the specified format: "El mcd de a i b es X."
*   **Type Hinting:** The function signature `mcd(a: int, b: int) -> int` enhances code clarity and maintainability by indicating the expected types of arguments and the return value.

**Weaknesses (Minor):**

*   **Stylistic Point:** The parentheses around `(a)` in `return (a)` in the base case are unnecessary and can be removed for slightly cleaner Pythonic code (`return a`).
*   **Recursion Depth (Theoretical):** While not a practical concern for the typical input ranges in competitive programming due to the Euclidean algorithm's rapid convergence, deep recursion can theoretically lead to stack overflow errors in Python for extremely large inputs (though such inputs are rare for this problem type).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Remove Redundant Parentheses:** For improved code aesthetics, change `return (a)` to `return a` in the base case of the `mcd` function.

Overall, the program is a well-crafted, efficient, and correct solution to the problem, successfully implementing the Euclidean algorithm. The minor points mentioned do not detract from its quality, as evidenced by its "Accepted" status.
