### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires you to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, the task is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is also a multiple of `b`.

Your program adopts a direct mathematical approach to solve this. It calculates `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This is a common and efficient way to compute `ceil(a / b) * b`, which mathematically yields the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness of Logic:** The core mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is perfectly correct for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for all natural numbers `a` (including 0) and `b >= 1`.
    *   **Efficiency:** The solution performs a constant number of arithmetic operations for each test case (O(1) complexity per case), making it highly efficient.
    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The code is straightforward, easy to read, and directly implements the solution without unnecessary complexity.
    *   **Output Format Adherence:** The output format `"#{} : {}"` correctly matches the problem's specification.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Input Format Assumption (Most Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The problem description states "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b", which typically implies reading pairs of numbers until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, without an explicit initial line indicating the number of test cases. Your current program starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, assuming that the very first line of input provides the total number of test cases. If the actual test system's input does not provide this initial count, your program will attempt to interpret the first `a` value as the number of cases, leading to incorrect processing or a runtime error (e.g., `ValueError` if `a` is not a single integer, or simply processing the wrong number of cases), resulting in a "Wrong Answer" verdict.
    *   **Ambiguity of "Natural Numbers":** While the formula handles `a=0` correctly, it's worth noting that "natural numbers" can sometimes be ambiguously defined (either `1, 2, 3, ...` or `0, 1, 2, 3, ...`). However, this is unlikely to be the primary cause of a "Wrong Answer" as the formula is robust.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust Input Reading for EOF:** To address the most probable cause of the "Wrong Answer," modify your program to read pairs of numbers until the End-Of-File (EOF) is encountered, which is a common input pattern for problems like this. This typically involves a `while` loop with a `try-except EOFError` block or checking for empty input lines.

    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1
    # Read lines from standard input until EOF
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and check if the line is empty
        stripped_line = line.strip()
        if not stripped_line:
            continue # Skip empty lines

        try:
            a, b = map(int, stripped_line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
            case_num += 1
        except ValueError:
            # Handle cases where line might not contain two integers (e.g., malformed input)
            # For competitive programming, usually assume valid input format
            pass # Or re-raise, or log error
    ```
    *Alternatively, if the problem setter *did* intend the first line to be the number of cases, your original input method is fine, and the "Wrong Answer" would hint at an even more subtle issue, but the EOF pattern is more standard for "sequence of pairs".*

With the mathematical logic being sound and the output format correct, the input handling is the most critical area to review when encountering a "Wrong Answer" verdict on such a problem.
