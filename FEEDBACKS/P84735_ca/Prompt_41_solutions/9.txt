Here's a feedback text for your program:

### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks you to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, you need to find and print the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and also a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as `#case_number : x`, with case numbers starting from 1.

Your program attempts to solve this problem using the mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly calculates the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division. For example, if `a=10, b=3`, `x = (10 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 12 // 3 * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`. If `a=9, b=3`, `x = (9 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 11 // 3 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly solves the problem's objective for each `(a, b)` pair. This is a standard and efficient way to compute the "ceiling multiple".
    *   **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The solution is very compact and uses a constant number of operations for each pair, making it highly efficient.
    *   **Clear Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement accurately matches the specified output format, correctly including the case number.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling (Primary Issue):** The most critical weakness, and almost certainly the cause of the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is the way your program reads input. The line `casos = int(input())` assumes that the first line of input will be a single integer indicating the total number of test cases. However, the problem description ("L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b") implies that the input is a continuous sequence of `a b` pairs, usually ending at EOF (End Of File), without a preceding count. When the program tries to convert the first `a b` pair into a single integer, it will likely result in a `ValueError` or an incorrect `casos` value, leading to incorrect program behavior or a runtime error.
    *   **Reliance on Fixed Number of Cases:** Because of the `casos = int(input())` line, your `while i <= casos:` loop expects a fixed number of test cases, which contradicts the "sequence of pairs" input style common on programming judges.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The main improvement needed is to adjust your input reading mechanism to handle a sequence of pairs until EOF.

Here's how you can modify your code to correctly read input for problems with this typical structure:

```python
i = 1
while True:
    try:
        a, b = map(int, input().split()) # Reads one line, splits it, converts parts to integers
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    except EOFError:
        # This exception is raised when input() attempts to read past the end of the file.
        break # Exit the loop when there's no more input.
    except ValueError:
        # This can happen if a line is empty or contains non-integer data.
        # For this specific problem, it's less likely with valid input,
        # but good for robustness.
        break
```

By making this change, your program will correctly read and process each pair `a b` until the input stream is exhausted, resolving the "Wrong Answer" issue. The core calculation is already perfectly fine!
