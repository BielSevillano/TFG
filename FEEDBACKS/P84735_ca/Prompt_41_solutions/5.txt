The feedback for your Python program for the "Múltiple més petit" problem is as follows:

### 1. Problem Summary

The problem asks you to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, you need to find and print the smallest natural number `x` that satisfies two conditions: `x` must be greater than or equal to `a` (`x >= a`), and `x` must be a multiple of `b` (`x = m * b` for some natural number `m`). The output should be formatted as `#case_number : x`, with case numbers starting from 1.

### 2. Solution Approach Summary

Your Python program attempts to solve this problem by first reading an integer `casos`, which it assumes to be the total number of test cases. It then enters a `while` loop that iterates `casos` times. In each iteration, it reads a line containing two integers `a` and `b`. The core logic calculates `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. Finally, it prints the case number and the calculated `x` in the specified format.

### 3. Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Calculation of `x`**: The formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically correct and efficient way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It effectively performs a "ceiling division" (`ceil(a/b) * b`). This part of your code is robust and handles various inputs correctly (e.g., when `a` is already a multiple of `b`, or when `a` is not).
    *   **Correct Output Format**: The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case numbering starting from 1.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling**: The most significant weakness, and likely the cause of the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is how the program handles input. The problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b". This typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` continuously until there is no more input (End-Of-File, EOF), without an initial line specifying the number of test cases. Your program's first line, `casos = int(input())`, attempts to read the number of test cases. This will consume the very first input line (which should be the first `a, b` pair) or cause a `ValueError` if the first input line cannot be parsed as a single integer, leading to an incorrect execution flow and wrong results.
    *   **Redundant Input Reading for Test Cases**: If the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the number of test cases as the first input, then reading `casos` is not only incorrect but also unnecessary.

### 4. Suggestions for Improvement

To fix the "Wrong Answer" and make your program conform to the problem's input specification, you should adjust the input reading mechanism:

1.  **Remove the initial `casos = int(input())` line.**
2.  **Change the `while` loop to read input until End-Of-File (EOF).** In Python, a common way to do this is using a `try-except EOFError` block with `input()`, or by iterating through `sys.stdin` if you import the `sys` module.

Here's an improved version of your code incorporating these suggestions:

```python
import sys

case_num = 1 # Initialize case number starting from 1

# Read lines from standard input until EOF
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Split the line and convert parts to integers a and b
    a, b = map(int, line.split())
    
    # Calculate the smallest multiple of b that is >= a
    # This calculation is correct.
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    
    # Print the result in the specified format
    print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
    
    # Increment case number for the next pair
    case_num += 1

```

This revised code correctly handles the input as a sequence of `a` and `b` pairs until EOF, addresses the "Wrong Answer" likely caused by incorrect input parsing, and retains the efficient and correct calculation logic for `x`.
