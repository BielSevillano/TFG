### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and the Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks the programmer to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, the goal is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `x` is also a multiple of `b`. The output for each case should follow a specific format: `#case_number : result`.

The provided Python program approaches this problem by first reading the total number of test cases. Then, in a loop that runs for each test case, it reads `a` and `b`. The core of its solution lies in the mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula effectively calculates the "ceiling" of `a/b` (i.e., `ceil(a/b)`) and then multiplies it by `b` to get the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. For example, if `a=7, b=3`, `(7+3-1)//3*3 = (9)//3*3 = 3*3 = 9`. If `a=6, b=3`, `(6+3-1)//3*3 = (8)//3*3 = 2*3 = 6`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The core logic `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a well-known and mathematically sound method for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It correctly handles both cases where `a` is already a multiple of `b` and where it is not.
    *   **Efficiency:** The solution is highly efficient, performing a constant number of arithmetic operations per test case. This results in O(1) time complexity per case, which is optimal.
    *   **Clarity:** The code is concise and easy to understand. The variable names are clear, and the structure is straightforward.
    *   **Standard I/O:** The program correctly handles input by reading the number of test cases first and then processing each `a, b` pair, which is standard practice in competitive programming.
    *   **Output Format:** The output `"#{} : {}".format(i, x)` precisely matches the specified format including the case number.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Unexpected "Wrong Answer":** Given the problem description for "Múltiple més petit" and the established correctness and efficiency of the Python code, the "Wrong Answer" verdict is highly unexpected. The code appears to flawlessly solve the problem as stated.
    *   **Discrepancy with Reference Solutions:** It's important to note that the "other possible solutions" provided are for a completely different problem (likely "Paraules més freqüents" or "Most Frequent Words," given their use of strings, vectors, sorting, and frequency counting for `n` words and `k` most frequent). This strong discrepancy suggests a potential misconfiguration of the problem statement or the judging environment for this specific submission, rather than an error in the Python code itself for the "Múltiple més petit" problem.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **For the "Múltiple més petit" Problem:** No functional improvements are needed for the current code. It is already efficient, correct, and adheres to the problem specifications.
*   **Addressing the "Wrong Answer":**
    1.  **Verify Problem Mapping:** Double-check that this Python code was indeed submitted to the "Múltiple més petit" problem on the platform, and not accidentally to a different problem (like "Paraules més freqüents").
    2.  **Verify Problem Statement:** Confirm that the problem description on the judging system is precisely the one provided here. If the actual problem on the judge is different (e.g., "Paraules més freqüents"), then the Python code would naturally be incorrect.
    3.  **Edge Case Scrutiny (though unlikely to be the issue here):** While the formula is robust, one might consider extreme values of `a` and `b` to ensure no integer overflow (though Python handles large integers automatically) or division by zero (guaranteed `b >= 1`). However, this is very unlikely to be the cause of a "Wrong Answer" given the formula's general applicability.

In conclusion, the Python program is a correct and efficient solution to the "Múltiple més petit" problem as described. The "Wrong Answer" likely stems from an external issue related to problem setup or submission context, rather than a flaw in the code's logic for the described task.
