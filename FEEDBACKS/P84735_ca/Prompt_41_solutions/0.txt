### Feedback for the program: Múltiple més petit

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and the Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks you to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b` is always greater than or equal to 1). For each pair, you need to find the smallest natural number `x` that satisfies two conditions: `x` must be greater than or equal to `a`, and `x` must be a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as `#case_number : result`.

The provided Python program adopts a direct mathematical approach. For each input pair `(a, b)`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is a common and efficient way to determine the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly solves the problem for positive natural numbers `a` and `b` (and even works correctly for `a=0` if it were allowed). It ensures that `x` is a multiple of `b` and is the smallest such multiple that is `>= a`.
    *   **Concise and Efficient:** The solution is very compact, performing a constant number of arithmetic operations per test case, making it highly efficient (O(1) complexity per case).
    *   **Clear Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` line correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case number.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling (Primary Issue for "Wrong Answer"):** The main reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly how the program reads input. The problem description states "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," which implies reading input pairs continuously until the End-Of-File (EOF). Your code, however, starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, assuming the first line of input specifies the total number of test cases. This mismatch in input format leads to an error (e.g., a `ValueError` if the first line is `a b` instead of just an integer, or incorrect processing if it happens to be a single number that is part of the `a b` pair).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Input Reading for EOF:** The program needs to be modified to read input pairs `a, b` continuously until there is no more input, instead of expecting an initial count of test cases. In Python, this is typically done by iterating over `sys.stdin`.

    ```python
    import sys

    case_number = 1
    # Iterate through each line provided in the standard input
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Split the line into two parts and convert them to integers
        a, b = map(int, line.split())

        # Calculate the smallest multiple of b that is greater than or equal to a
        # This formula works correctly for a >= 0 and b >= 1
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b

        # Print the result in the specified format for the current case
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_number, x))

        # Increment the case number for the next input pair
        case_number += 1
    ```

By implementing this change in input reading, your program's logical correctness for the problem should lead to a successful submission. The mathematical logic itself is perfectly suited for the task.
