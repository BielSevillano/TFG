This program aims to solve the "Múltiple més petit" problem, which requires finding the smallest natural number `x` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`.

### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`) and, for each pair, output the smallest natural number `x` such that `x >= a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as `"#case_number : x"`.

**Solution Approach:**
The program attempts to solve this by:
1.  Reading an initial integer, presumably the number of test cases.
2.  Iterating `casos` times.
3.  In each iteration, reading `a` and `b`.
4.  Calculating `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`.
5.  Printing the result in the specified format with a 1-based case number.

**Code's Strengths:**
*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically sound and efficient way to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This formula effectively performs a "ceiling division" (`ceil(a/b)`) and then multiplies by `b`.
    *   For example, if `a=10, b=3`: `(10 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 12 // 3 * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`.
    *   If `a=9, b=3`: `(9 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 11 // 3 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9`.
    *   This part of the solution is robust for the given constraints (`a` natural, `b >= 1`).
*   **Clear Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the 1-based case numbering.
*   **Readability:** The code is concise and easy to understand.

**Code's Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
The most probable cause for a "Wrong Answer" given the correctness of the core calculation lies in the **input reading mechanism**.
*   **Misinterpretation of Input Format:** The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` *until the End Of File (EOF)*, without an explicit initial count of test cases.
*   The current code starts by `casos = int(input())`. If the input stream does not begin with an integer representing the number of cases, but instead with the first pair `a b`, then:
    *   `int(input())` will attempt to parse the first `a` value as `casos`. This might fail (if `a` is not parsable as the *only* integer on the first line) or, more likely, succeed but `casos` will be an incorrect number.
    *   Consequently, the `while i <= casos:` loop will either run the wrong number of times or attempt to read non-existent input, leading to incorrect results for the actual test cases or runtime errors.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Correct Input Handling for Multiple Test Cases (Until EOF):** Modify the input loop to read pairs `a, b` until there's no more input. In Python, a common way to do this in competitive programming is:
    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Strip newline and split the line into parts
        parts = line.strip().split()
        if not parts: # Handle empty lines if necessary
            continue

        a = int(parts[0])
        b = int(parts[1])

        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
        case_num += 1
    ```
    Alternatively, using a `try-except EOFError` block:
    ```python
    case_num = 1
    while True:
        try:
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
            case_num += 1
        except EOFError:
            break
        except ValueError: # Handle potential empty lines or malformed input
            break
    ```
    This change addresses the most likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" status.

2.  **Clarify "Natural Numbers":** While the current formula handles `a=0` correctly if natural numbers include 0, it's always good practice to confirm the precise definition in the context of the problem (e.g., `N = {1, 2, 3, ...}` or `N = {0, 1, 2, ...}`). Given `a` and `b` are usually positive in such problems, the formula is perfectly fine.
