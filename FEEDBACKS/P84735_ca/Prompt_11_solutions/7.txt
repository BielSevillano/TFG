Here's a feedback text for the program:

**Feedback for Program: Múltiple més petit**

This program aims to solve the "Múltiple més petit" problem, which requires finding the smallest natural number `x` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b`.

---

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. For example, if `a=12` and `b=5`, the smallest multiple of 5 that is `p>=12` is `15`. The provided Python program attempts to solve this using the mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly calculates the "ceiling division" `ceil(a/b)` and then multiplies it by `b` to get the desired result. The program also correctly formats the output with a case number.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant and efficient way to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` (for positive `a` and `b`). This part of the solution is mathematically sound.
    *   **Readability:** The code is concise, clear, and easy to understand.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case number.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling (Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The primary weakness, and almost certainly the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, lies in how the program handles input. The problem description states, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," implying that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until the end of the input (EOF). However, the current code starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, expecting the very first line of input to be a single integer indicating the total number of test cases. If the input provided by Jutge.org for this problem does not start with a count of cases, this will lead to a `ValueError` (if the first line contains "a b") or an incorrect number of iterations, causing the program to fail or produce wrong results for subsequent cases.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The fundamental logic for calculating `x` is correct. The main improvement needed is to adapt the input reading mechanism to match the problem's specified input format:

1.  **Read until End Of File (EOF):** Instead of reading a fixed number of `casos`, modify the loop to read input lines continuously until there are no more lines to process. This is typically done using a `while True` loop combined with `try-except` blocks for `EOFError` or `ValueError` (in case of an empty line or malformed input at the end), or by iterating directly over `sys.stdin`.

    Here's how you can modify the input loop using `sys.stdin` (which is common in competitive programming environments for "read until EOF" scenarios):

    ```python
    import sys

    i = 1
    # Iterate over each line provided in the standard input
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Split the line into two parts and convert them to integers
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        
        # Calculate the smallest multiple
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
        # Print the result in the specified format
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        
        # Increment the case counter
        i += 1
    ```

By making this change to the input handling, the program will correctly process all pairs of `a` and `b` as described in the problem, and its accurate core logic will then yield the correct output for each case.
