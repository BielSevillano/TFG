### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, it must calculate and output the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by reading a number of test cases first, then iterating through each case. For each pair `(a, b)`, it uses the mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` to directly compute the desired smallest multiple.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Formula:** The core of the solution, the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`, is mathematically sound and correctly calculates the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This is a standard and efficient way to solve this specific problem.
    *   **Efficiency:** The calculation for each test case is `O(1)`, making the solution very efficient regardless of the input values of `a` and `b`.
    *   **Readability:** The code is concise and easy to understand, directly implementing the logic.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The output `"#{} : {}".format(i, x)` correctly matches the specified format in the problem description.

*   **Weaknesses (Likely Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Input Format Mismatch:** The most probable reason for a "Wrong Answer" verdict is an incorrect assumption about the input structure. The problem description, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," typically implies that the program should read `a` and `b` pairs repeatedly until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, without a preceding line specifying the total number of test cases.
        The current code, however, starts by `casos = int(input())`, expecting the very first line of input to be an integer indicating the number of test cases. If the actual input stream directly starts with `a b` pairs, this line will either cause a `ValueError` (if "a b" cannot be converted to an integer) or misinterpret the first value `a` as the number of cases, leading to incorrect processing and ultimately a "Wrong Answer".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Adapt to EOF-terminated Input:** Modify the input reading loop to handle a sequence of inputs until EOF. This is the common pattern for problems described as "sequence of...". An updated structure would look like this:

    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input() # Read a full line
            if not line: # Handle potential empty lines or immediate EOF after a read
                break
            a, b = map(int, line.split()) # Parse a and b from the line
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError: # Catch EOF signal when input() tries to read past end
            break
        except ValueError: # Catch potential errors if a line is malformed or not an int
            break
    ```

*   **Clarify Input Specification:** If possible, always confirm the exact input format from the problem source (e.g., Jutge.org). This helps avoid assumptions and ensures the program's input handling matches the judge's expectations.

*Self-correction Note:* The "other possible solutions" provided in the prompt are for entirely different problems (e.g., processing words, time calculations, base conversion) and are completely irrelevant to the "Múltiple més petit" problem. They have been disregarded in this analysis.
