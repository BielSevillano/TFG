**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks us to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b` is always greater than or equal to 1). For each pair, the goal is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` that satisfies two conditions: `x` must be greater than or equal to `a`, and `x` must be a multiple of `b`.

The provided Python program implements a direct mathematical solution. For each input pair `(a, b)`, it calculates `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is a standard way to compute `ceil(a/b) * b`, which effectively finds the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. The program then prints this calculated `x`, prefixed by a case number, following the specified output format.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Core Logic:** The mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is perfectly suited for this problem. It correctly computes the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive integers `a` and `b >= 1`.
*   **Efficiency:** The calculation for each test case is a constant-time operation (O(1)), making the solution highly efficient and optimal in terms of computational complexity.
*   **Conciseness:** The code is very concise and directly implements the mathematical solution, making it easy to understand the core logic.
*   **Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case number and separator.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The most probable reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is how the program handles input. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies that input should be read until the End Of File (EOF) is reached, without an initial line specifying the total number of test cases.
    *   The line `casos = int(input())` assumes that the first line of input will provide the total count of `a, b` pairs. If the judging system feeds input as a continuous stream of `a, b` pairs without this initial count, this line will attempt to interpret the first `a` value as the case count. This misalignment will cause the program to read incorrect values for `a` and `b` in subsequent iterations, leading to incorrect results for all or most test cases.
    *   The "other possible solutions" (though unrelated to the problem's logic) provided for reference often use a `while (cin >> n >> k)` structure in C++, which is the standard way to read until EOF, further supporting this input interpretation.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To resolve the "Wrong Answer," the program needs to adjust its input reading mechanism to continuously process pairs of `a` and `b` until there is no more input (EOF). The core logic for calculating `x` is already correct and does not need modification.

Here's how you can modify the input loop in Python to read until EOF, which is typical for such problem descriptions on online judges:

```python
import sys

case_num = 1
# Iterate over each line provided in standard input until EOF
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and split the line into parts
    # This handles cases where a line might have extra spaces or be empty
    parts = line.strip().split()
    
    # Skip empty lines if any
    if not parts:
        continue
    
    # Convert parts to integers (assuming exactly two integers per line)
    a = int(parts[0])
    b = int(parts[1])
    
    # Calculate the smallest multiple (core logic remains unchanged)
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    
    # Print the result in the specified format
    print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
    case_num += 1

```
This revised input structure will correctly process all `a, b` pairs provided in the input stream, addressing the likely cause of the "Wrong Answer."
