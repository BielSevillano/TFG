### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**Problem Description Summary:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires writing a program that reads pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, the program must calculate and print the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as `#case_number : result`.

**Solution Approach Summary:**
The provided Python program attempts to solve this by first reading an integer `casos` which it assumes represents the total number of test cases. It then enters a `while` loop, iterating `casos` times. In each iteration, it reads a pair `a` and `b`, calculates `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`, and prints the result with the case number.

**Analysis of the Code:**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically correct and efficient way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive `a` and `b`. This is a common trick for implementing ceiling division (`ceil(a / b) * b`). For example:
    *   If `a=7, b=3`: `(7 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 9 // 3 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9`. (Correct, `9 >= 7` and `9` is a multiple of `3`).
    *   If `a=10, b=5`: `(10 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 14 // 5 * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10`. (Correct, `10 >= 10` and `10` is a multiple of `5`).
2.  **Efficiency:** The calculation for each pair `(a, b)` is O(1), making the overall solution very efficient per test case.
3.  **Output Format:** The program correctly adheres to the specified output format `#{} : {}`.

**Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
1.  **Incorrect Input Handling:** This is the most likely reason for the "Wrong Answer". The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies that the program should read pairs of numbers until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, without an initial line specifying the number of test cases. The current code starts with `casos = int(input())`, which expects the *first line* of input to be the count of test cases. If the actual input just starts directly with `a b` pairs, this line will either:
    *   Cause a `ValueError` if the first `a b` pair cannot be parsed as a single integer (e.g., if it's "7 3").
    *   Incorrectly interpret the first `a` value as `casos`, leading to incorrect looping and processing of subsequent input lines.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust Input Loop for EOF Handling:** Change the main loop to read input until EOF, rather than reading a fixed number of cases. In Python, a common way to do this is:

    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            break
        except ValueError: # Handle potential issues if line is empty or malformed
            break # Or handle appropriately
    ```

2.  **Consider Using `sys.stdin` (Optional but robust):** For competitive programming, reading from `sys.stdin` and handling potential errors can be more robust, especially for large inputs.

3.  **Modern Python Formatting (Optional):** Use f-strings for slightly cleaner output formatting:
    ```python
    print(f"#{i} : {x}")
    ```

**Regarding the "other possible solutions" for reference:**
It appears the provided "other possible solutions" are **not relevant** to the "Múltiple més petit" problem. They are mostly C++ code snippets that deal with string manipulation, vectors of strings, sorting, counting word frequencies, and even time calculations (`struct Temps`), which are completely different problems from finding the smallest multiple. Please disregard them for the context of this specific problem.
