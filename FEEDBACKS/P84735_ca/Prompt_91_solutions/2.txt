### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that reads pairs of natural numbers, `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`). For each pair, it must calculate and output the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a 1-indexed case number.

The provided Python program adopts a direct mathematical approach to find `x`. It uses the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`, which effectively computes `ceil(a / b) * b` using integer division. This formula correctly determines the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Calculation Logic:** The core mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant, correct, and efficient way to find the smallest multiple `x`. It handles various cases, including when `a` is already a multiple of `b`, or when `a` is less than `b`.
    *   **Conciseness and Readability:** The Python code is very compact and easy to understand, clearly reflecting the mathematical solution.
    *   **Efficiency:** For each pair `(a, b)`, the calculation of `x` is a constant-time operation (O(1)), making the program highly efficient per test case.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The most significant weakness, and likely the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is how the program reads input. The problem description states "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b...", which typically implies reading input pairs until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, rather than reading a fixed number of test cases specified by an initial integer. The current code starts with `casos = int(input())`, assuming the first line provides the total number of test cases. If the input format does not include this initial count, or if it provides an indefinite sequence of pairs, the program will either misinterpret the first input value or encounter a runtime error.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adapt Input Loop for EOF Handling:** The primary improvement needed is to modify the input loop to correctly handle a sequence of pairs until EOF. This is a common pattern in competitive programming. Here's how you could modify the Python code:

    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1
    for line in sys.stdin:  # Iterate over lines from standard input
        line = line.strip() # Remove leading/trailing whitespace, including newline
        if not line:        # Skip empty lines if any
            continue
        try:
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
            case_num += 1
        except ValueError:
            # Handle cases where a line might not contain two integers,
            # or the input stream unexpectedly ends.
            # For most competitive programming, this means stopping or ignoring.
            break
    ```
    Alternatively, using a `while True` loop with `input()` and catching `EOFError`:
    ```python
    case_num = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
            case_num += 1
        except EOFError:
            break # Exit the loop when no more input
        except ValueError:
            # Handle potential issues if a line doesn't parse correctly
            break # Or continue, depending on specific problem requirements
    ```
