### Feedback on "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks us to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, the goal is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `x` is also a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this by:
*   First, reading an integer `casos`, which it assumes to be the total number of test cases.
*   It then enters a `while` loop, iterating `casos` times.
*   In each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b`.
*   It calculates `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly computes the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division.
*   Finally, it prints the result in the specified format `"#{} : {}"`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths**:
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic**: The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and efficient for finding the smallest multiple of `b` greater than or equal to `a`. This part of the code correctly addresses the problem's central requirement.
    *   **Clear Variable Naming**: Variables like `a`, `b`, `x`, `casos`, and `i` are well-chosen and contribute to the readability of the code.
    *   **Correct Output Format**: The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement adheres to the requested output format for each case.

*   **Weaknesses**:
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling**: This is the primary reason for the "Wrong Answer". The problem statement specifies that "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b", implying that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` continuously until the end of the input stream (EOF), not a fixed number of test cases. The current code expects the *first line* of input to be the *count of test cases*, which is contrary to the problem description. This mismatch in input expectation will lead to incorrect behavior or crashes when tested with typical competitive programming platforms.
    *   **Unnecessary `casos` Variable**: Because the input is a sequence until EOF, the `casos` variable and the `while i <= casos:` loop structure are inappropriate. The case counter `i` should simply increment for each pair successfully read.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

The main improvement needed is to correctly handle the input as a sequence of pairs until EOF.

Here's how you can modify the program:

```python
import sys

i = 1
# Read lines from standard input until EOF
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Attempt to split the line and convert to integers
    # This automatically handles potential empty lines or malformed input
    a, b = map(int, line.split())
    
    # Calculate the smallest multiple of b that is greater than or equal to a
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    
    # Print the result in the specified format
    print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
    
    # Increment the case number for the next input pair
    i += 1

```

**Explanation of Changes:**
1.  **`import sys`**: Imports the `sys` module, which provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, including `sys.stdin` for reading from standard input.
2.  **`for line in sys.stdin:`**: This is the standard Python idiom for iterating over lines of input until EOF. It's more robust than `while True: try-except EOFError:` for this type of problem.
3.  **Removed `casos = int(input())`**: The program no longer expects an initial count of test cases.
4.  **`i` as a simple counter**: The variable `i` correctly serves as the case number and increments with each valid input pair.

By implementing these changes, your program will correctly interpret the input format as described in the problem statement, while retaining the correct and efficient logic for calculating the smallest multiple.
