### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a program that reads pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b ≥ 1`). For each pair, it must compute and print the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1.

**Solution Approach:**
The program correctly identifies a common and efficient mathematical formula to solve the core problem: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula works by effectively "rounding up" `a` to the nearest multiple of `b`.
- `(a + b - 1)`: This expression ensures that if `a` is already a multiple of `b`, or just above a multiple, the result will correctly round up or stay at `a`.
- `// b`: Performs integer division, which discards the remainder, effectively finding how many times `b` fits into the (adjusted) `a`.
- `* b`: Multiplies the result of the integer division by `b` to yield the desired smallest multiple.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The arithmetic expression `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is perfectly suited for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This is the most crucial part of the solution, and it is implemented correctly.
    *   **Clear and Concise:** The code is easy to read and understand, with logical steps for input, calculation, and output.
    *   **Correct Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly produces the output in the specified format, including the case number.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling (Major Flaw):** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly the first line `casos = int(input())`. The problem statement describes the input as "a sequence of pairs of natural numbers a and b," which implies that the program should read pairs until the End-Of-File (EOF). It *does not* state that the first line contains the total number of test cases. By attempting to read an integer as the number of cases, the program will either consume the first `a, b` pair as the `casos` variable (leading to incorrect processing of subsequent data) or fail if the first line is not a single integer.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Input Loop for EOF:** The program needs to be modified to read `a` and `b` pairs continuously until there is no more input. In Python, this is typically done using a `while True` loop combined with `sys.stdin.readline()` and a check for an empty line, or by catching an `EOFError`.

    Here's how you can modify the input loop:

    ```python
    import sys

    case_number = 1
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Check if the line is empty (might happen at EOF in some environments)
        if not line.strip():
            break
        
        try:
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(case_number, x))
            case_number += 1
        except ValueError:
            # Handle cases where a line might not contain two integers
            # For competitive programming, usually input is guaranteed to be valid.
            # So, this block might not be strictly necessary, but good for robustness.
            break 
    ```
    This revised structure correctly handles a sequence of inputs until EOF, addressing the likely cause of the "Wrong Answer".
