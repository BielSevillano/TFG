Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires finding the smallest natural number `x` that is greater than or equal to a given natural number `a`, and is simultaneously a multiple of another given natural number `b` (where `b ≥ 1`). This process needs to be repeated for a sequence of such pairs `(a, b)`. The output for each pair should be formatted with a case number.

The provided Python program implements an efficient mathematical formula to solve this: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly calculates `ceil(a / b) * b`, which yields the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. The program then iterates a specified number of times (determined by an initial `casos` input) to process each `(a, b)` pair and prints the result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically sound and standard approach to find the smallest multiple of `b` greater than or equal to `a` for positive integers. It handles various scenarios correctly, including when `a` is already a multiple of `b`, or when `b=1`.
    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The code is straightforward, easy to read, and directly implements the solution strategy.
    *   **Output Format:** The program correctly formats the output by including the case number as specified.

*   **Weaknesses / Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
    *   **Input Format Mismatch (Highly Probable Cause):** The most likely reason for receiving a "Wrong Answer" is a discrepancy in how the program expects to read input versus how the judging system provides it. The current Python code assumes the first line of input will be an integer (`casos`) indicating the total number of test cases (`casos = int(input())`). However, problems described as taking "a sequence of pairs `a` and `b`" (like "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b") often imply reading `a` and `b` pairs repeatedly *until the End-Of-File (EOF)*, without an explicit initial case count. If the judge system directly provides an `a` value on the first line, `int(input())` would attempt to convert that `a` into the `casos` variable, leading to incorrect parsing, potential `ValueError`s, or processing the wrong number of cases.

    *   **Irrelevant Reference Solutions:** It's important to mention that the "other possible solutions" provided in your context are for a completely different problem (related to finding most frequent words, involving strings and sorting), not "Múltiple més petit". This implies a potential mix-up in problem descriptions or reference materials, but the Python code itself is clearly written for the given "Múltiple més petit" problem.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Verify the Exact Input Specification:** The most critical step is to clarify the precise input format required by the platform.
    *   **If the input *does* start with the number of cases:** The current Python code for the "Múltiple més petit" logic should be correct. The "Wrong Answer" would then point to a more subtle issue (e.g., specific edge cases not considered, though the formula is quite robust, or platform environment differences).
    *   **If the input provides `a, b` pairs until EOF:** You need to modify your input loop to handle reading lines until there's no more input. A standard Python pattern for this is:

        ```python
        import sys

        case_num = 1
        for line in sys.stdin:
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
            case_num += 1
        ```
        This approach iterates over lines from standard input until EOF, correctly handling an unspecified number of test cases.

By adjusting the input reading to match the expected format, your program should correctly solve the "Múltiple més petit" problem.
