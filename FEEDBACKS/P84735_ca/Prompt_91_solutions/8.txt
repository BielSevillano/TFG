### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and the Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers, `a` and `b`, and for each pair, output the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The provided Python program tackles this by using a direct mathematical formula: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula efficiently calculates `ceil(a / b) * b`, which is the definition of the desired smallest multiple.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core of the solution, `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`, is a standard and mathematically sound way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It correctly handles various scenarios, including when `a` is already a multiple of `b` or when `a` is 0 (assuming natural numbers can include 0, otherwise `a` is positive).
    *   **Efficiency:** The program uses only constant-time arithmetic operations for each `(a, b)` pair, making it highly efficient regardless of the input values' magnitude (within standard integer limits).
    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, directly implementing the chosen mathematical approach.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The output format `"#{} : {}"` correctly matches the problem's specified output requirements, including case numbering.

*   **Weaknesses (Likely reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Input Format Mismatch:** The most probable cause for the "Wrong Answer" is a misunderstanding of the input format. The problem description states, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b...", which typically implies that input pairs `a b` will be provided continuously until the End-Of-File (EOF). However, your program starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, expecting the very first line of input to be an integer specifying the total number of test cases. If the actual input from the judging system does not begin with such a count, your program will misinterpret the input stream, leading to incorrect results or a runtime error.
    *   **Irrelevant Reference Solutions:** It's important to highlight that the "other possible solutions" provided in the prompt are entirely unrelated to the "Múltiple més petit" problem. They appear to be solutions for a problem involving counting word frequencies and printing the most frequent ones. Therefore, they cannot be used as a valid reference for evaluating this specific Python program.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Adapt Input Handling to EOF:** The primary improvement is to modify the input loop to read pairs until EOF, as is common for problems described as a "sequence of" inputs without an explicit count.

    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Strip leading/trailing whitespace and check for empty lines
        stripped_line = line.strip()
        if not stripped_line:
            continue # Skip empty lines if they might appear in input

        a, b = map(int, stripped_line.split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
        case_num += 1
    ```
    This modification will allow the program to process an indefinite sequence of `a b` pairs correctly until the input stream is exhausted, which is the most likely intended behavior for the problem statement.
