### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b ≥ 1`). For each pair, it must calculate and output the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as `"#case_number : result"`.

The provided Python program approaches the core mathematical problem by using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula effectively calculates `ceil(a/b) * b`, which is a standard and correct way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer arithmetic.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is accurate and efficiently solves the problem of finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is `≥ a`. This is the strongest aspect of the code.
    *   **Output Format:** The program correctly formats the output as `"#case_number : result"`, adhering to the problem's specification.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Input Handling Mismatch:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is highly likely the way the program handles input. The problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b", which typically implies reading pairs until the End-Of-File (EOF). However, your program starts by reading an integer `casos` to determine the number of test cases (`casos = int(input())`) and then loops `casos` times. If the judging system provides input as a continuous stream of `a, b` pairs without an initial count, your program will misinterpret or fail to read the input correctly. This mismatch in expected input format versus actual input format will inevitably lead to a "Wrong Answer" or a runtime error.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To resolve the "Wrong Answer" and make the program robust for "read until EOF" input, modify the input loop as follows:

1.  **Remove the initial `casos = int(input())` line.** The problem does not specify a fixed number of test cases.
2.  **Change the `while` loop to handle input until End-Of-File (EOF).** In Python, this is commonly done with a `try-except` block around the input operations.

Here's the corrected version of your program:

```python
i = 1 # Initialize case counter

# Loop indefinitely, trying to read input.
# An EOFError will occur when there's no more input.
while True:
    try:
        a, b = map(int, input().split()) # Read a pair of integers
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b        # Calculate the smallest multiple
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))  # Print the result
        i += 1                          # Increment case counter
    except EOFError:
        break                           # Exit loop when EOF is reached
    except ValueError:
        # This might catch cases where input() returns an empty string
        # or non-integer input, though problem statement implies valid natural numbers.
        break
```
