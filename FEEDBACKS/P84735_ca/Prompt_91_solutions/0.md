This document provides feedback on a Python program designed to solve the "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) problem.

## Problem Description

The problem requires writing a program that reads pairs of natural numbers, `a` and `b`. For each pair, the program should output the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number starting from 1.

## Solution Approach

The provided Python program iterates through pairs of input numbers `a` and `b`. For each pair, it checks if `a` is already a multiple of `b`. If it is, `a` is printed as the result. Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `b` that is greater than `a`. This is achieved by integer division `a // b`, adding 1 to get the next multiplier, and then multiplying by `b`.

## Code Analysis

### Strengths:

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
*   **Readability:** The code is reasonably clear and easy to understand. Variable names like `cas` (case) and `a`, `b` are appropriate for the problem.
*   **Input Handling:** The `try-except` block effectively handles the end of input, allowing the program to terminate gracefully.
*   **Output Formatting:** The output correctly includes the case number and the calculated result in the specified format.
*   **Efficiency:** The mathematical approach `(a // b + 1) * b` (when `a` is not a multiple of `b`) is an efficient way to find the next multiple, avoiding unnecessary loops.

### Weaknesses:

*   **Import `yogi`:** The program relies on the `yogi` library for input. While this is common in competitive programming environments, in a general context, it might be better to use standard Python input methods unless explicitly required.
*   **Redundant Check:** The `if a % b == 0:` check is good, but the subsequent `else` block calculates `(a // b + 1) * b`. A slightly more concise way to express this, especially if `a` is a multiple of `b`, would be to ensure the result is always `>= a`.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **More Concise Calculation:** The calculation for the smallest multiple greater than or equal to `a` can be unified.
    *   The current `if a % b == 0: print(a)` is correct.
    *   The `else: print((a // b + 1) * b)` is also correct.
    *   A single, more robust mathematical expression could be used. For instance, `math.ceil(a / b) * b` would achieve the same result. In Python, this can be achieved with `((a + b - 1) // b) * b`. This expression works for both cases:
        *   If `a` is a multiple of `b`, `a % b` is 0. Then `(a + b - 1) // b` will be `a // b`. For example, if `a=6, b=3`, `(6+3-1)//3 = 8//3 = 2`. Then `2 * 3 = 6`.
        *   If `a` is not a multiple of `b`, `a % b` is not 0. For example, if `a=7, b=3`, `(7+3-1)//3 = 9//3 = 3`. Then `3 * 3 = 9`. This correctly finds the next multiple.

    *   **Revised logic example:**
        ```python
        import yogi
        import math # or use integer arithmetic

        cas = 1
        while True:
            try:
                a = yogi.read(int)
                b = yogi.read(int)
            except Exception:
                break
            
            # Option 1: Using math.ceil (requires import math)
            # result = math.ceil(a / b) * b
            
            # Option 2: Using integer arithmetic
            result = ((a + b - 1) // b) * b 
            
            print("#{} : {}".format(cas, result))
            cas += 1
        ```
        This would simplify the `if/else` block.

2.  **Standard Input (Optional):** If `yogi` is a specific library for competitive programming platforms, you might want to consider how this code would run with standard Python input (`input()`, `sys.stdin.readline()`) for broader applicability. However, for the context of Jutge.org, `yogi` is likely the intended input method.

3.  **Variable Naming (Minor):** While `cas` is understandable, `case_num` or `case_count` might be slightly more descriptive in English. Similarly, `a` and `b` are standard for mathematical problems.

## Conclusion

The provided Python program is a well-written and correct solution to the "Múltiple més petit" problem. It effectively handles input and produces the desired output. The suggested improvement is primarily for code conciseness by unifying the calculation logic, rather than fixing any functional errors.
