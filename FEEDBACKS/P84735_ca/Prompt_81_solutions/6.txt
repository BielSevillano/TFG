### Feedback: Múltiple més petit (Smallest multiple)

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem asks to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b`. For each pair, the program must find and print the smallest natural number `x` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as `"#case_number : x"`, with case numbers starting from 1.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by using a standard mathematical formula to calculate `x`: `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly finds the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic for Calculation:** The core logic `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and efficient for determining the smallest multiple of `b` greater than or equal to `a`.
    *   **Clear Output Formatting:** The use of `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` correctly adheres to the specified output format for each case.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is likely an incorrect assumption about the input format. The problem description states, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b...", which typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until the end of the input (EOF - End Of File).
        The current code, however, assumes that the first line of input will be an integer (`casos`) indicating the total number of test cases, and then it loops exactly `casos` times. If the input instead starts directly with `a b` pairs without an initial `casos` count, this will lead to a `ValueError` (Runtime Error) or processing an incorrect number of test cases (Wrong Answer) if `casos` is present but the problem requires processing until EOF. Given the "Wrong Answer" status, it's highly probable the code processes a different number of cases than expected, either too few or too many, based on this input mismatch.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To fix the "Wrong Answer", the input reading mechanism needs to be adjusted to handle an unknown number of test cases until EOF, as implied by the problem statement:

1.  **Remove `casos` variable:** The variable `casos = int(input())` should be removed, as the problem does not specify an initial count of test cases.
2.  **Change the main loop for EOF handling:** Replace the `while i <= casos:` loop with a construct that reads input lines until EOF. A common way to do this in Python is using a `try-except EOFError` block or iterating directly over `sys.stdin`.

Here's how the corrected input handling would look:

```python
import sys

i = 1 # Initialize case number
for line in sys.stdin: # Iterate over lines from standard input until EOF
    a, b = map(int, line.split()) # Parse a and b from the current line
    
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b # Calculate the smallest multiple
    
    print("#{} : {}".format(i, x)) # Print the result in the specified format
    i += 1 # Increment case number for the next iteration
```

Alternatively, using `while True` with `try-except`:

```python
i = 1 # Initialize case number
while True:
    try:
        a, b = map(int, input().split()) # Read a line and parse a and b
        
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b # Calculate the smallest multiple
        
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x)) # Print the result
        i += 1 # Increment case number
    except EOFError:
        # Break the loop when no more input is available (End Of File)
        break
    except ValueError:
        # Handle cases where input line might be empty or malformed,
        # though often not strictly necessary for well-behaved competitive programming inputs.
        break
```
