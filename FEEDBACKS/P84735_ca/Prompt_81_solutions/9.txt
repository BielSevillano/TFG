This feedback addresses the provided Python program for the "Múltiple més petit" problem.

### 1. Brief Summary of the Problem and the Solution Approach

**Problem:** The task is to write a program that, for each given pair of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b` ≥ 1), finds and prints the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

**Solution Approach:** The provided program uses a mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` to calculate the smallest multiple. This formula effectively computes `ceil(a / b) * b` for positive `a` and `b`, which correctly identifies the desired smallest multiple. It then prints the result in the specified format for each test case.

### 2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Core Logic:** The formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically sound and efficient way to calculate the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This works correctly for all natural numbers `a` (including 0) and `b >= 1`.
*   **Clear Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly matches the common output format for competitive programming platforms like Jutge.org, including the case numbering.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The most significant weakness, and likely the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is how the program handles input. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" implies that input pairs should be read *until the end of the input stream (EOF)*, not for a fixed number of test cases specified on the first line. The line `casos = int(input())` incorrectly assumes the first line of input indicates the total number of test cases, which is not stated in the problem description for "Múltiple més petit".

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Modify Input Loop to Handle EOF:**
    Change the `while i <= casos:` loop to read input until End-Of-File (EOF). This is standard practice when the number of test cases is not explicitly given.

    **Example of corrected input handling in Python:**

    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1
    # Iterate over lines from standard input until EOF
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Split the line and convert parts to integers
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        
        # Apply the correct formula
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
        # Print the result in the specified format
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
        
        case_num += 1
    ```
    Alternatively, using a `while True` loop with `try-except EOFError`:
    ```python
    case_num = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
            case_num += 1
        except EOFError:
            break # Exit the loop when EOF is reached
    ```

By implementing this change, the program will correctly process all input pairs as specified by the problem statement, which should resolve the "Wrong Answer".
