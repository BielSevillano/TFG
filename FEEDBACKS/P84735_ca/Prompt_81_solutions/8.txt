**Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks the programmer to write a program that, for each given pair of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b` is guaranteed to be `1` or greater), finds and prints the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and is a multiple of `b`. The output for each pair should be preceded by a case number, starting from 1, in a specified format (e.g., `#1 : 10`).

The provided Python program implements a solution by:
*   Reading an initial integer, which it assumes represents the total number of test cases.
*   Entering a loop that iterates for the number of cases read.
*   Within each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from a single line.
*   It calculates the desired smallest multiple `x` using the mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`.
*   Finally, it prints the case number and the calculated value `x` in the format `#case_number : x`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a well-known and mathematically sound method for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This formula correctly handles both cases where `a` is already a multiple of `b` and where it is not, for positive `a` and `b`.
*   **Conciseness and Readability:** The Python code is very compact and easy to understand, clearly illustrating the intended logic.
*   **Efficient Calculation:** The formula uses simple arithmetic operations and integer division, making the calculation of `x` very efficient.
*   **Correct Output Format (Assuming Example):** The program prints the output with case numbers in the format `#{} : {}`, which aligns with typical competitive programming requirements.

**Weaknesses (Likely Cause for "Wrong Answer"):**

*   **Input Format Mismatch:** The most probable reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the input format specified by the problem.
    The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b..." (The input consists of a sequence of pairs of natural numbers a and b...) typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` on separate lines **until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached**.
    However, your Python program starts with `casos = int(input())` and then loops `casos` times. This structure explicitly expects the *first line of input to contain a single integer specifying the total number of test cases*. If the actual input data does not begin with a case count, but rather with the first pair of `a` and `b`, then `int(input())` would try to parse the first `a` value as the number of cases. This would lead to incorrect program execution, such as:
    *   Reading the wrong number of test cases.
    *   Attempting to parse non-integer data if `a` isn't a simple integer (though unlikely for `naturals`).
    *   Potentially causing an `EOFError` if it tries to read more cases than available, or stopping prematurely if it reads fewer.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To resolve the "Wrong Answer", the primary suggestion is to modify the input reading mechanism to correctly handle input until EOF, which is the standard interpretation for problem statements like this:

1.  **Adjust Input Reading for EOF:** Change the main loop to continuously read lines from standard input until no more input is available (EOF). A common and robust way to do this in Python is using `sys.stdin`:

    ```python
    import sys

    case_number = 1
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # It's good practice to strip whitespace and check if the line is not empty
        stripped_line = line.strip()
        if not stripped_line:
            continue # Skip empty lines that might occur before EOF or between test cases

        a, b = map(int, stripped_line.split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_number, x))
        case_number += 1
    ```

This modification directly addresses the most likely cause of the "Wrong Answer" by correctly interpreting the typical input format for "sequence of pairs" problems. If after this change the issue persists, carefully re-checking any provided example inputs and outputs for specific edge cases or subtle format requirements would be the next step.
