### Feedback for the "Múltiple més petit" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks the user to write a program that, for a given pair of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), finds the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output for each pair should be formatted as "#case_number : x".

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program employs a direct mathematical formula to calculate the smallest multiple. For each pair `(a, b)`, it calculates `x` using the expression `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is a common and efficient way to compute `ceil(a / b) * b`, which correctly determines the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic for Calculation:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly solves the problem for given `a` and `b`. It efficiently finds the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division properties.
    *   **Clear Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement generates output that appears to conform to the specified format.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is very likely the way the program reads input. The line `casos = int(input())` assumes that the first line of the input provides the total number of test cases. However, the problem statement ("L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b...") typically implies that the program should read pairs `(a, b)` continuously until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, without an explicit case count upfront. This mismatch in input expectation will cause the program to either process the wrong number of cases or misinterpret the input data, leading to incorrect results. If the first line of the actual test input is `a` for the first pair, it would be incorrectly interpreted as `casos`.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Revise Input Loop for EOF Handling:** The most crucial improvement is to modify how input is read. Instead of reading an initial `casos` value, the program should loop, reading `a` and `b` for each test case, until no more input is available (EOF).

    Here's an example of how to implement this in Python, using `sys.stdin` for robustness:

    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Check if the line is empty (can happen at EOF or with blank lines)
        if not line.strip(): 
            break
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
        case_num += 1
    ```
    This approach ensures that all input pairs are processed correctly, adhering to the typical "sequence of pairs until EOF" input pattern.

By addressing the input handling, the program should correctly solve the "Múltiple més petit" problem.
