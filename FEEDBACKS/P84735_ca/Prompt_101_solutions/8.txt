Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers, `a` and `b` (where `b ≥ 1`). For each pair, it must find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is also a multiple of `b`. The output for each pair should be preceded by a case number, starting from 1.

The provided Python program employs a standard mathematical technique to find `x`. The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` effectively performs a "ceiling division" (calculating `ceil(a / b)`) and then multiplies the result by `b`. This correctly determines the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive integers `a` and `b`. For example, if `a=7` and `b=3`, `x = (7 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 9 // 3 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9`. If `a=9` and `b=3`, `x = (9 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 11 // 3 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is an efficient and mathematically sound way to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This part of the solution is robust.
    *   **Clear Output Formatting:** The output statement `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` accurately follows the specified format, including the case number.

*   **Weaknesses (and Probable Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The most significant issue, and the likely cause for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is how the program reads its input. The line `casos = int(input())` assumes that the first line of input provides an integer specifying the total number of test cases. However, the problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies that input pairs (`a` and `b`) are provided one after another until the end of the input stream (EOF), without an initial count of cases.
        *   If the input format indeed follows the "sequence until EOF" pattern, `int(input())` will attempt to parse the first `a, b` pair's line as a single integer. This would either lead to a `ValueError` (if "7 3" cannot be converted to an integer) or incorrectly set `casos` (if the first `a` value happens to be on a line by itself or if `a` is incorrectly parsed, leading to an incorrect number of iterations). This mismatch between the problem's input specification and the code's input reading is a common reason for "Wrong Answer" in competitive programming environments.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To resolve the input handling issue, the program should be modified to read `a, b` pairs continuously until there is no more input (end-of-file).

Here's how you can adapt the code for this:

```python
import sys

i = 1
# Read lines from standard input until EOF
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and split the line into two parts
    a_str, b_str = line.strip().split()
    
    # Convert parts to integers
    a = int(a_str)
    b = int(b_str)
    
    # Calculate the smallest multiple
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    
    # Print the result in the specified format
    print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
    
    # Increment the case counter
    i += 1

```

Alternatively, using a `while True` loop with error handling for `input()`:

```python
i = 1
while True:
    try:
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    except EOFError:
        # Break the loop when there's no more input
        break
    except ValueError:
        # This catch is optional, but can handle malformed lines if expected
        # For competitive programming, EOFError is usually sufficient
        break
```

This correction addresses the probable cause of the "Wrong Answer" by correctly interpreting the input format as a sequence of pairs rather than a fixed number of test cases.
