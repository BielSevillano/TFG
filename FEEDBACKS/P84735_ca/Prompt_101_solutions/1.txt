### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b`. For each pair, it must calculate and print the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1.

The provided program uses a clever and efficient mathematical formula to find the desired `x`: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula effectively "rounds up" `a` to the nearest multiple of `b`. For instance, if `a=12` and `b=5`, `(12 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 16 // 5 * 5 = 3 * 5 = 15`. If `a=10` and `b=5`, `(10 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 14 // 5 * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10`. This approach is mathematically sound for positive `a` and `b`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Core Logic:** The formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant and correct way to solve the problem's mathematical core. It's efficient as it relies on simple arithmetic operations.
*   **Clear Variable Names:** Variables like `a`, `b`, `x`, `casos`, and `i` are well-chosen and contribute to the readability of the code.
*   **Correct Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement adheres to the specified output format, including the case number.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary weakness, and likely the reason for the "Wrong Answer," is the way the program handles input. The problem statement says, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," which typically implies reading input until the End-Of-File (EOF). However, your code begins by reading an integer `casos` to determine the number of iterations: `casos = int(input())`. If the judge system's input does not provide this initial `casos` value (which is common for "sequence of pairs" problems on Jutge.org), the program will fail by either misinterpreting the first pair `a, b` as `casos` or by encountering an `EOFError` or `ValueError` unexpectedly.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

The core logic is excellent, so the main improvement needed is in handling the input stream:

1.  **Adopt EOF-based Input Reading:** Modify the `while` loop to continuously read pairs `a` and `b` until there is no more input, rather than relying on an initial `casos` count. This is the standard pattern for problems describing a "sequence" of inputs.

    Here's how you can implement this in Python:

    ```python
    import sys

    i = 1 # Initialize case counter
    for line in sys.stdin: # Reads lines from standard input until EOF
        parts = line.split()
        if len(parts) == 2: # Ensure the line contains two numbers
            a = int(parts[0])
            b = int(parts[1])
            
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        # Optional: handle malformed lines if necessary, though problem constraints usually guarantee valid input
    ```
    Alternatively, a more common competitive programming idiom:
    ```python
    i = 1 # Initialize case counter
    while True:
        try:
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError: # Catches the exception when there's no more input
            break
        except ValueError: # Catches if input is not two integers (e.g., empty line)
            # Depending on problem specifics, you might want to break or continue
            break # Assuming an empty line also signals end of useful input
    ```

By making this change, your program should correctly process the input as intended by the problem statement and likely resolve the "Wrong Answer" error.
