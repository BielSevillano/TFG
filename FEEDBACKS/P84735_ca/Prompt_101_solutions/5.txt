**Subject: Feedback on "Múltiple més petit" Program (Python)**

Dear programmer,

Thank you for submitting your solution. Here's a review of your program for the "Múltiple més petit" problem.

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks you to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b ≥ 1`). For each pair, you need to find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`. The output should include a case number.

Your program tackles this problem by using a concise mathematical formula: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This expression is a well-known method to calculate the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It essentially computes `ceil(a / b) * b` using integer division.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness (for the specified problem):** The core logic `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly solves the "Múltiple més petit" problem. It accurately finds the desired multiple for various inputs of `a` and `b`.
    *   **Efficiency:** The solution is highly efficient. Each calculation for `x` involves a constant number of arithmetic operations (O(1)), making the program very fast even with many test cases.
    *   **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is brief, clear, and easy to understand.
    *   **Correct Output Formatting:** The program correctly reads the number of cases, iterates through them, and formats the output for each case as specified (`#case_number : x`).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Discrepancy with "Wrong Answer" Status:** The most significant "weakness" here is not in your code's logic for the "Múltiple més petit" problem, but in the "Wrong Answer" result itself. Based on the problem description you provided, your solution is correct and robust. The presence of numerous C++ "other possible solutions" that deal with counting word frequencies and sorting by frequency strongly suggests that your Python code might have been evaluated against a *different problem* (e.g., "K paraules més freqüents") than the "Múltiple més petit" problem described. If this is the case, the "Wrong Answer" is expected because the code is not designed for that alternative problem.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarify the Actual Problem:** The most crucial recommendation is to confirm the exact problem statement that your Python code was submitted for.
    *   **If your code *was indeed submitted for the "Múltiple més petit" problem* and received a "Wrong Answer,"** I would advise a thorough re-check of the problem's specific input constraints and expected output format, looking for any subtle details. However, conceptually, your solution for "Múltiple més petit" is sound.
    *   **If the problem was actually the "K paraules més freqüents" problem (as indicated by the reference C++ solutions),** your current Python code is not applicable and would require a complete redesign. This would involve:
        *   Reading `n` words and an integer `k`.
        *   Using a data structure (like a dictionary in Python) to count the occurrences of each unique word.
        *   Converting this frequency data into a list of (word, count) pairs.
        *   Sorting this list: primarily by count in descending order, and secondarily by word alphabetically in ascending order for tie-breaking.
        *   Finally, printing the first `k` words from this sorted list.

In conclusion, your Python solution is an excellent and efficient implementation for the "Múltiple més petit" problem as described. The "Wrong Answer" status is highly likely due to the code being evaluated against a different problem than what it was written to solve.
