### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks the user to write a program that, for several pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), finds the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is also a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as `#case_number : x`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program adopts a direct mathematical approach. For each pair `(a, b)`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is designed to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It effectively rounds `a/b` up to the nearest integer (ceiling division) and then multiplies by `b`. The program then prints the result in the specified format, iterating through a predefined number of cases.

**Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically sound and efficient way to calculate the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive integers `a` and `b`. Python's integer division (`//`) performs floor division, which is crucial for this formula's correctness.
    *   **Clear Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case number.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The most probable reason for the "Wrong Answer" lies in how the program reads its input. The current code starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, assuming that the first line of input will always contain the total number of test cases. However, typical competitive programming problems on platforms like Jutge.org, especially those described as "a sequence of pairs," often use an "End-Of-File (EOF)" input mechanism where pairs `a` and `b` are read repeatedly until there is no more input. If the input format for "Múltiple més petit" does not provide an initial count of cases, then `int(input())` would attempt to parse the first `a` (or `a, b` pair) as the case count, leading to a `ValueError` or incorrect program execution.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust Input Loop for EOF:** Change the input loop to continuously read `a` and `b` until the End-Of-File is reached. This is a common pattern for problems where the number of test cases isn't explicitly given at the start.

    ```python
    import sys

    i = 1 # Initialize case counter

    # Loop to read input until EOF
    for line in sys.stdin:
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        
        # Core logic remains correct
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    ```
    *   Alternatively, for cases where an explicit `EOFError` is preferred to catch, one could use a `try-except` block:
        ```python
        i = 1 # Initialize case counter
        while True:
            try:
                a, b = map(int, input().split())
                x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
                print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
                i += 1
            except EOFError:
                break
            except ValueError: # Handle potential empty lines or malformed input
                break 
        ```

By correcting the input reading mechanism to match the problem's typical input style, the program should produce the correct output. The mathematical logic itself is sound for the problem statement.
