### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, it must calculate and output the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by:
- Reading an initial integer `casos`, assuming it represents the total number of test cases.
- Looping `casos` times.
- In each iteration, reading `a` and `b`.
- Calculating `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly determines the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive integers.
- Printing the result in the specified format, using a counter `i` for the case number.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is an efficient and mathematically sound way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It effectively implements `ceil(a/b) * b` using integer arithmetic.
*   **Clear Output Formatting:** The use of `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` correctly adheres to the required output format, including the case number.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Input Reading Strategy:** This is the most significant weakness and the probable cause for the "Wrong Answer". The program starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, implying that the first line of input provides the total number of test cases. However, the problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b amb b ≥ 1." This typically indicates that input pairs `a b` will be provided continuously until the End-Of-File (EOF), without a preceding count of test cases. The C++ reference solutions for similar problems usually confirm this pattern by using `while (cin >> n >> k)`. This mismatch between the assumed input format and the actual problem specification leads to incorrect program behavior.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To correct the "Wrong Answer" and align with the typical input format for "sequence of pairs" problems, the input reading mechanism should be changed.

1.  **Adopt EOF-based Input Reading:** Modify the main loop to read pairs `a, b` until there is no more input (EOF). The case counter `i` should still be maintained to print the case number for each pair.

    Here's how you could modify the Python code:

    ```python
    import sys

    i = 1
    # Read lines from standard input until EOF
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Split the line and convert parts to integers
        a, b = map(int, line.split())

        # Calculate the smallest multiple
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b

        # Print the result in the specified format
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))

        # Increment the case counter
        i += 1
    ```

    This revised approach correctly handles a sequence of input pairs until EOF, making the program robust against the common input patterns for this type of problem.
