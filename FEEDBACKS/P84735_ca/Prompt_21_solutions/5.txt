**Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program**

The program aims to solve the "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) problem.

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`). For each pair, the task is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

The provided Python program adopts a direct mathematical approach to find `x`. It correctly identifies that `x` can be found by calculating `ceil(a / b) * b`. In integer arithmetic, `ceil(A / B)` for positive integers `A` and `B` can be efficiently computed as `(A + B - 1) // B`. The program uses this exact formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` to determine the desired multiple.

**2. Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant and correct way to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division. This is a strength as the calculation itself is sound.
    *   **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is brief and easy to understand, directly implementing the solution.
    *   **Correct Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format (case number followed by the result).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** This is the most critical weakness and the likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict. The problem description states "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," which implies that the program should read `a` and `b` pairs *until the End Of File (EOF)*. However, the current code `casos = int(input())` expects the very first line of input to be a single integer indicating the total number of test cases. If the judge's input does not start with a case count, but rather directly with `a b` pairs, the program will misinterpret the input or raise an error, leading to incorrect results.
    *   **Limited Error Handling:** While not explicitly required by the problem, the current input loop could crash if `input()` receives non-integer values (though problem constraints usually guarantee valid input).

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Input Loop for EOF:**
    Modify the input reading mechanism to continuously read `a, b` pairs until there is no more input, rather than relying on a predefined number of `casos`.

    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            break
        except ValueError: # Optional: handle malformed input lines if necessary
            # print("Invalid input line, skipping:", line)
            break # Or continue, depending on desired behavior
    ```

    This change addresses the fundamental mismatch between the problem's input specification and the program's input parsing.

2.  **Add Comments (Optional but Recommended):**
    While the code is short, adding a comment to explain the `(a + b - 1) // b * b` formula (e.g., "Calculates ceil(a/b) * b") would enhance clarity for future readers or for self-review.

**Note on Reference Solutions:**

The provided C++ "reference solutions" are completely unrelated to the "Múltiple més petit" problem. They appear to be solutions for a different problem involving counting word frequencies and sorting them (e.g., "Paraules més freqüents"). Therefore, they are not useful for evaluating or improving this specific Python code. The feedback above focuses solely on the Python code's correctness concerning the problem it's intended to solve.
