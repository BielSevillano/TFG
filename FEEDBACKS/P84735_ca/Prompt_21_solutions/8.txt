### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks the programmer to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, the goal is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by directly calculating `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is a mathematically sound and efficient way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Core Logic Correctness:** The mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is perfectly correct for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is `>= a`, given `a >= 0` and `b >= 1`. This is a very efficient, O(1) calculation per pair.
    *   **Conciseness:** The calculation itself is expressed in a single, clear line of code.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly follows the requested output format (e.g., `#1 : 12`).

*   **Weaknesses (and likely cause of "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary weakness, and almost certainly the reason for the "Wrong Answer," lies in how the program reads input. The problem statement indicates that "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," which implies reading pairs until the End-Of-File (EOF). However, the program starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, assuming that the first line of input will be an integer specifying the total number of test cases.
        *   Based on the problem description and typical Jutge.org problem formats for "seqüència de parells," there is no initial integer indicating the number of test cases.
        *   When run, the program will attempt to interpret the *first value of `a`* from the actual input sequence (e.g., `10` from `10 3`) as `casos`. This immediately throws off all subsequent input reads, causing the program to parse `a` and `b` incorrectly or terminate prematurely, leading to a "Wrong Answer."

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The main improvement needed is to correct the input reading loop to match the problem's specified input format:

1.  **Read until End-Of-File (EOF):** Modify the `while` loop to continuously read pairs `a` and `b` until there is no more input. In Python, this is commonly done using a `try-except EOFError` block.

**Revised Code Example:**

```python
i = 1 # Initialize case counter

while True:
    try:
        # Attempt to read a line of input
        line = input()
        
        # If the line is empty, it might be an EOF signal or an extra newline, break loop
        if not line:
            break
            
        # Parse a and b from the line
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        
        # Calculate the smallest multiple
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
        # Print the result in the specified format
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        
        # Increment case counter
        i += 1
        
    except EOFError:
        # Break the loop if EOF is reached (no more input)
        break

```

By implementing this change, the program will correctly process all input pairs as specified by the problem, and its mathematically sound core logic will then produce the correct results.
