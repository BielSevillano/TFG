### Feedback for Program: Múltiple més petit

**1. Problem and Solution Summary:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks to find, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The program should output this `x` for each pair, preceded by a case number.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this by reading input pairs `a` and `b` in a loop. For each pair, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` and then prints the result in the specified format.

**2. Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is an efficient and mathematically sound way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This formula correctly implements the concept of ceiling division (`ceil(a / b) * b`), which is suitable for the problem constraints (natural numbers `a`, and `b >= 1`).
    *   **Clear Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly formats the output as required, including the case number and the calculated multiple.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is very likely the way the program reads its input. The problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b", which typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` continuously until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached. However, the current code starts with `casos = int(input())`, assuming the *first line of input* will be a single integer specifying the total number of test cases. This mismatch means the program will either:
        *   Fail to parse the first line if it contains an `a, b` pair (e.g., trying to convert "10 3" to an integer will raise a `ValueError`).
        *   Incorrectly interpret the first `a` value as the number of cases if the problem input unexpectedly starts with a single integer (which is not standard for "sequence of pairs").
        In either scenario, the subsequent input reading and processing will be incorrect.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To correct the input handling and resolve the "Wrong Answer," modify the main loop to read lines until an `EOFError` is encountered, rather than relying on a predetermined initial count of test cases.

Here's how the corrected input loop should look:

```python
i = 1 # Initialize case counter
while True:
    try:
        line = input() # Read an entire line of input
        a, b = map(int, line.split()) # Split the line and convert to integers
        
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b # Calculate the smallest multiple
        
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x)) # Print the formatted output
        i += 1 # Increment case counter for the next iteration
    except EOFError:
        # If input() raises EOFError, it means there are no more lines to read.
        # This is the correct way to terminate the loop for "sequence of pairs" input.
        break
    except ValueError:
        # This block is optional but can handle cases where a line might be empty
        # or contain non-integer values before EOF. For competitive programming,
        # problem statements usually guarantee valid input, so EOFError is often sufficient.
        break 
```
By making this change, your program will correctly process all input pairs until the end of the input stream, aligning with typical "sequence of pairs" problem specifications.
