### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires reading pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, the task is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as "Case #: x", with cases numbered starting from 1.

The provided program attempts to solve this by:
*   Reading an initial integer to determine the number of test cases.
*   Looping `casos` times, reading `a` and `b` for each iteration.
*   Calculating `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly computes the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive integers `a` and `b` (it's equivalent to `ceil(a/b) * b`).
*   Printing the result in the specified format for each case.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and efficient for determining the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This part of the solution is robust.
*   **Correct Output Formatting:** The use of `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` correctly adheres to the specified output format for each case.
*   **Clarity:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly the way the program handles input. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies that input pairs `(a, b)` will be provided until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, without an explicit initial number of test cases.
    The current code `casos = int(input())` assumes the first line of input specifies `casos`, which contradicts the usual interpretation of such problem descriptions on platforms like Jutge.org. If the input data does not start with a `casos` integer, the program will misinterpret the first `a` value as the number of cases, leading to incorrect iteration counts and reading subsequent lines incorrectly, thus failing most test cases.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To resolve the "Wrong Answer" and correctly handle the input as described:

1.  **Modify the Input Loop:** Change the main loop to read pairs `a, b` until an `EOFError` occurs (indicating no more input). This is a standard pattern for problems where the number of test cases is not explicitly given upfront.

Here's the corrected code snippet:

```python
import sys # Import sys for reading lines if needed, though try-except EOFError is common

i = 1 # Initialize case counter
while True:
    try:
        # Read a line of input
        line = input()
        # If the line is empty (might happen before EOF on some systems) or EOF is reached
        if not line:
            break
        
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        
        # Calculate the smallest multiple of b greater than or equal to a
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
        # Print the result in the specified format
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        
        # Increment the case counter
        i += 1
    except EOFError:
        # Break the loop when End-Of-File is reached
        break
    except ValueError:
        # Optional: Handle cases where a line might not contain two integers
        # For competitive programming, usually EOFError is sufficient, or input format is guaranteed.
        break

```
By implementing this change, the program will correctly process all input pairs `(a, b)` as provided by the system until no more input is available, aligning with the problem's input specification and likely resolving the "Wrong Answer".
