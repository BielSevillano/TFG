Here's a feedback text for your program:

### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires you to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, you must find and output the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

Your program adopts a direct mathematical approach to solve this. It uses the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It then prints the result in the specified format, iterating through an assumed number of test cases.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Core Logic:** The most significant strength of your code is that the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically correct and efficient way to calculate the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This part of your solution is robust for all valid inputs of `a` and `b`.
    *   For example, if `a=12, b=5`, `(12 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 16 // 5 * 5 = 3 * 5 = 15`. Correct.
    *   If `a=10, b=5`, `(10 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 14 // 5 * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10`. Correct.
*   **Correct Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the required output format, including the case number.
*   **Clarity:** The code is concise and easy to understand.

**Weaknesses / Reason for "Wrong Answer":**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling (Most Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" implies that the input will be a stream of `a, b` pairs, and the program should continue reading until the end of the input (EOF - End Of File).
    Your current code, `casos = int(input())`, assumes that the *first line* of the input will contain an integer specifying the *total number of test cases*. If the input doesn't start with a number of cases but instead immediately starts with the first `a b` pair (e.g., `10 5`), then `int(input())` will attempt to convert `10 5` (or whatever the first line is) into an integer, leading to a `ValueError`. Even if it manages to read an integer (e.g., if the first `a` value is alone on the first line), it will misinterpret the input structure. This is the most common reason for a "Wrong Answer" verdict when the core algorithm is correct in competitive programming environments like Jutge.org.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The primary improvement needed is to adjust the input reading mechanism to handle an unspecified number of input lines until EOF.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import sys

i = 1
# Iterate over each line provided in the standard input until EOF
for line in sys.stdin:
    try:
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    except ValueError:
        # This might happen if a line is empty or malformed,
        # though for typical competitive programming, input is well-formed.
        # It's good practice to handle, but often 'break' is sufficient.
        break
```

Alternatively, a common pattern using a `while True` loop:

```python
i = 1
while True:
    try:
        line = input() # Reads one line at a time
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    except EOFError: # Catches the end of input stream
        break
    except ValueError: # Catches issues like empty lines or non-integer input
        break
```

By making this change, your program will correctly process all input pairs until there are no more, resolving the likely cause of the "Wrong Answer".
