### Feedback on "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b`, where `b` is guaranteed to be at least 1. For each pair, it must calculate and output the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output for each case needs to be formatted as `#<case_number> : <result>`, starting with case 1.

The Python program adopts a standard mathematical approach to solve this. It uses the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` to compute `x`. This formula effectively performs a "ceiling division" of `a` by `b` (finding `ceil(a/b)`) and then multiplies the result by `b` to get the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Core Logic:** The most critical part of the solution—the calculation of `x` using `(a + b - 1) // b * b`—is mathematically sound and correctly implemented. This formula efficiently finds the desired smallest multiple for all valid positive `a` and `b`.
*   **Clear Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement accurately adheres to the specified output format, including the case number and the colon separator.
*   **Pythonic Integer Handling:** Python's integers handle arbitrary precision, meaning the program will correctly process `a` and `b` values of any size without concerns about overflow that might arise in other languages.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Input Reading Mechanism:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" status is highly likely due to a mismatch in how the program expects input versus how the problem specifies it. The code begins with `casos = int(input())`, which implies that the very first line of input will be an integer indicating the total number of test cases that follow. However, the problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically signifies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, without an initial case count. If the input stream doesn't start with a case count, the program will either fail (e.g., `ValueError` if `a` is not a single integer on the first line) or process an incorrect number of cases, leading to a "Wrong Answer."

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Revise Input Reading for EOF:** The program should be modified to read input pairs repeatedly until the End-Of-File (EOF) is encountered, rather than depending on an initial integer count. This is a common pattern for "sequence of inputs" problems in competitive programming.

    Here are two common ways to implement this in Python:

    *   **Using `while True` with `try-except EOFError`:**
        ```python
        i = 1
        while True:
            try:
                line = input()
                if not line: # Handle potential empty line before EOF in some systems
                    break
                a, b = map(int, line.split())
                x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
                print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
                i += 1
            except EOFError:
                break
            except ValueError: # Optional: Catches errors if line is not 'int int'
                break
        ```

    *   **Using `sys.stdin` (often preferred for robust EOF handling):**
        ```python
        import sys

        i = 1
        for line in sys.stdin:
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        ```

2.  **Careful Interpretation of Problem Statements:** Always pay close attention to the exact phrasing in the "Entrada" (Input) section of a problem. Phrases like "seqüència de parells" (sequence of pairs) or "fins a fi de fitxer" (until end of file) usually imply reading until EOF. Phrases like "La primera línia conté un enter N..." (The first line contains an integer N...) specifically call for reading an initial case count.

By implementing the correct input reading strategy, the program's robust core logic will be able to produce the correct output for all test cases as intended by the problem statement.
