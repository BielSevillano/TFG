### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks to find, for given natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`. The program attempts to solve this by using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`, which is a standard and efficient way to calculate the ceiling division `ceil(a / b)` multiplied by `b`. This correctly finds the desired multiple.

**2. Code Analysis (Strengths and Weaknesses):**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` for calculating `x` is perfectly sound and efficient. It correctly handles cases where `a` is already a multiple of `b`, or when `a` is not, returning the smallest multiple of `b` that is `>= a`.
    *   **Readability:** The code is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
    *   **Efficiency:** The calculation of `x` is a constant-time operation for each pair of `a` and `b`.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Reading:** This is the most critical issue leading to the "Wrong Answer". The problem description states "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b", which implies that the program should read pairs `a` and `b` repeatedly until the end of the input (EOF). The current program, however, expects an initial integer indicating the `casos` (number of test cases) to follow. This mismatch in input format specification is almost certainly why it receives a "Wrong Answer" verdict.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The main improvement needed is to adapt the input reading mechanism to match the problem's specifications:

*   **Modify Input Loop for EOF:** Remove the initial `casos = int(input())` line and change the `while` loop to continuously read input until an `EOFError` occurs.

Here's how the corrected input reading structure would look in Python:

```python
case_num = 1 # Initialize case_num as per output format
while True:
    try:
        line = input() # Read a line of input
        a, b = map(int, line.split()) # Parse a and b
        
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b # The calculation logic is correct
        
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x)) # Print result
        case_num += 1 # Increment for the next case
    except EOFError:
        # End of input reached
        break
    except ValueError:
        # Handle cases where input line is empty or malformed before EOF
        # (Though for competitive programming, input format is usually guaranteed until EOF)
        break

```
By implementing this change, the program will correctly process all input pairs as specified by the problem, resolving the "Wrong Answer". The logic for calculating `x` is already robust.
