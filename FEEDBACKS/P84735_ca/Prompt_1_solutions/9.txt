**Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program**

The provided Python program aims to solve the "Múltiple més petit" problem, which involves finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b`.

**1. Summary of the problem and solution approach:**

The problem requires reading pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`). For each pair, the program must calculate and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x >= a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output for each case needs to be formatted with a preceding case number, starting from 1.

The program's core approach utilizes the mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This is a well-known and efficient way to calculate the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It essentially computes `ceil(a / b) * b` using integer division. For example, if `a=10, b=3`, the formula gives `(10 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 12 // 3 * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`. If `a=9, b=3`, it gives `(9 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 11 // 3 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9`. This method is highly efficient, performing the calculation in constant time for each input pair.

**2. Analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and accurately solves the problem's central requirement. It handles various inputs (including when `a` is already a multiple of `b`) correctly.
    *   **Efficiency:** The calculation for each `a, b` pair is a constant-time operation, making the solution very efficient for large inputs.
    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The Python code is straightforward, easy to read, and directly implements the mathematical solution. Python's `map(int, input().split())` is an elegant way to parse multiple integers from a single line.
    *   **Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case numbering.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling (Primary Issue):** The most critical weakness, and the probable cause for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, lies in the input reading mechanism. The problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b", which typically implies that input pairs should be read until the End Of File (EOF) is reached. However, the program begins by reading `casos = int(input())`, assuming the first line of input provides the total number of test cases. If the actual test data on the platform does not start with a case count, or if it provides an arbitrary sequence of `a, b` pairs until EOF, this mismatch will lead to incorrect behavior (e.g., attempting to read a line that doesn't exist, misinterpreting data, or processing an incorrect number of cases).

**3. Suggestions for improvement:**

To correct the input handling and align it with the standard interpretation of "sequence of pairs" input in competitive programming, modify the program to read `a, b` pairs in a loop that continues until an `EOFError` is encountered, rather than relying on an initial `casos` variable.

Here's the suggested improvement for the input loop:

```python
i = 1
while True:
    try:
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    except EOFError:
        # No more input to read, gracefully exit the loop.
        # This is the expected way to handle "sequence of inputs" problems.
        break
    except ValueError:
        # This catch can be added for robustness to handle potentially empty lines
        # or malformed input that isn't an EOF, though EOFError is usually sufficient
        # for typical competitive programming platforms.
        break
```

By implementing this change, the program will correctly process all input pairs provided until the end of the input stream, which should resolve the "Wrong Answer" issue.
