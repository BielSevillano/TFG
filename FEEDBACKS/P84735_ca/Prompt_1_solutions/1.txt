### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks us to find, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this by:
*   Reading an initial integer `casos`, which it interprets as the total number of test cases.
*   Using a `while` loop to iterate `casos` times.
*   Inside the loop, it reads each pair `a` and `b`.
*   It calculates `x` using the mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`.
*   Finally, it prints the case number and the calculated `x` in the specified format.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Core Logic:** The formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant and correct way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`, assuming `a` and `b` are positive. This part of the calculation is mathematically sound and efficient.
*   **Correct Output Formatting:** The program correctly formats the output string, including the case number and the result `x` as specified by the problem.
*   **Clarity:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling (Most Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The problem description states, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b..." (The input consists of a sequence of pairs of natural numbers a and b...). This common phrasing on Jutge.org (and similar platforms) usually implies that input should be read **until the End-Of-File (EOF)**, not that an initial count of test cases (`casos`) is provided. The current code expects a specific number of test cases at the beginning, which likely does not match the actual input format, leading to a "Wrong Answer".
*   **Lack of Robustness for Edge Cases (Minor):** While the problem specifies `b >= 1`, in a general scenario, the formula and input validation would need to consider `b = 0` (which would lead to division by zero) or negative `a`/`b` (where integer division behavior can differ). For *this specific problem*, this is not an issue due to the constraints.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The primary improvement needed is to adapt the input reading mechanism.

*   **Modify Input Loop to Handle EOF:** Instead of reading a fixed number of cases, the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` continuously until there is no more input. This can be achieved using a `while True` loop combined with a `try-except EOFError` block in Python, or by iterating through `sys.stdin` if you import `sys`.

    Here's how you could modify the input loop:

    ```python
    import sys

    i = 1 # Initialize case counter
    # Loop indefinitely, reading lines from standard input
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Split the line and convert parts to integers
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        
        # Calculate the smallest multiple
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
        # Print the result in the specified format
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        
        # Increment case counter
        i += 1
    ```

    Alternatively, using `try-except` with `input()`:

    ```python
    i = 1 # Initialize case counter
    while True:
        try:
            # Read a line and split it
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            
            # Calculate the smallest multiple
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            
            # Print the result
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            
            # Increment case counter
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            # Break the loop when End-Of-File is reached
            break
    ```

By implementing this change, the program will correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement, which should resolve the "Wrong Answer".
