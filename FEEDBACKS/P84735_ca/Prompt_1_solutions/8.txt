### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to find, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b`, the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The program attempts to solve this by using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`, which is a common and efficient way to calculate the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division. It then prints the result in the specified format, including a case number.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Core Logic:** The mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is elegant and precisely calculates the desired "smallest multiple". This is an excellent use of integer arithmetic to achieve the `ceil(a/b) * b` operation.
*   **Efficiency:** The calculation for `x` is a constant-time operation, making the solution very efficient for each pair of `a` and `b`.
*   **Clear Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` line correctly implements the specified output format, including the case number.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling (Primary Issue):** The most significant weakness, and almost certainly the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, lies in the input loop. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically indicates that input should be read until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached. However, the current code starts by `casos = int(input())`, assuming the very first line of input provides the total number of test cases. This is a common pattern in some competitive programming problems, but it conflicts with the "sequence of pairs" phrasing, which usually implies EOF. If the actual input does not start with a case count, trying to interpret the first `a` value as `casos` will lead to incorrect program execution and ultimately a "Wrong Answer".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Correct Input Reading for EOF:** To correctly handle input that is a "sequence of pairs" until EOF, you should modify your main loop. The standard Python idiom for this is to use a `while True` loop combined with `try-except EOFError`.

    Here's how you could modify the input loop:

    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            break # Exit the loop when there's no more input
    ```

*   **Careful Reading of Input Specifications:** Always pay close attention to the exact wording of the "Entrada" (Input) section in programming problems. The distinction between "first line indicates number of test cases" and "read until EOF" is crucial and can often be the sole reason for a "Wrong Answer" even with perfect core logic.

By implementing the suggested change to the input handling, the program's strong core logic should allow it to pass correctly.
