## Feedback for Program: Múltiple més petit

### Problem and Solution Approach Summary

The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires reading pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b`. For each pair, the task is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should include a case number, starting from 1, formatted as "#CaseNum : Result".

The provided Python program attempts to solve this by:
1.  Reading an initial integer, presumably the number of test cases.
2.  Looping `casos` times, reading each `a` and `b` pair.
3.  Calculating `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`.
4.  Printing the result in the specified format.

### Code Analysis

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Calculation Logic:** The core mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant and efficient way to calculate the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This part of the solution is mathematically sound and handles all valid `a` and `b` inputs correctly (given `b >= 1`).
*   **Correct Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case number.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Input Format Misinterpretation (Primary Issue):** The most significant weakness, and likely the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is the way the program handles input. The problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b..." This typically implies that input pairs should be read until the End Of File (EOF), rather than being preceded by an explicit count of test cases.
    *   The line `casos = int(input())` expects the first line of input to be a single integer representing the number of test cases. If the actual input stream directly starts with an `a, b` pair, this line will either try to parse the `a` value as `casos` (leading to incorrect loop iterations) or raise a `ValueError` if the first line contains multiple numbers or non-numeric characters.

*   **Irrelevant Reference Solutions:** It's important to note that the provided C++ "other possible solutions" are for a completely different problem (dealing with word frequencies), and were not relevant for analyzing this specific "Smallest Multiple" problem. They should be disregarded.

### Suggestions for Improvement

To correct the "Wrong Answer" and align with the problem's input specification, the program should be modified to read input pairs until EOF:

1.  **Modify the Input Loop:** Replace the `casos = int(input())` and `while i <= casos:` structure with a `while True:` loop that handles `EOFError`.

**Revised Program:**

```python
import sys

i = 1
for line in sys.stdin: # Reads line by line until EOF
    # Strips any leading/trailing whitespace (like newline characters)
    # and splits the line into two numbers.
    a, b = map(int, line.strip().split())
    
    # The core logic remains correct
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    
    print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
    i += 1

```
This revised approach correctly interprets the problem's input format, ensuring that the program will process all provided `a` and `b` pairs until the end of the input stream.
