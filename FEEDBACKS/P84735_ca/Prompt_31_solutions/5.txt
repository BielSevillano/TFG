**Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`). For each pair, it must calculate and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1.

The provided Python program calculates `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This is a well-known and efficient method to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. It essentially computes `ceil(a / b) * b`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly identifies the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This part of the solution is elegant and efficient.
    *   **Clear Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement accurately adheres to the specified output format, including the case numbering.
    *   **Readability:** The code is concise, straightforward, and easy to understand.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling (Primary Issue):** The most critical flaw, and the probable cause of the "Wrong Answer" verdict, lies in the program's input mechanism. The line `casos = int(input())` assumes that the first line of input provides the total number of test cases. However, the problem description "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until the end of the input stream (EOF) is reached, without a preceding count of cases. If the judge system provides input pairs without a leading number of cases, the program will incorrectly parse the first `a` value as `casos`, leading to subsequent misinterpretation of the entire input and incorrect results.
    *   **Redundant `casos` Variable:** Consequently, if input is read until EOF, the `casos` variable and the fixed-iteration `while i <= casos:` loop are unnecessary.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Revise Input Loop for EOF Handling:** The most important change is to modify the program to read `a` and `b` pairs continuously until the end of the input stream (EOF). In Python, this is commonly done using a `while True` loop combined with a `try-except EOFError` block.

    **Example of revised input loop:**
    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            # If the input can have empty lines or unexpected format,
            # you might want to add checks here (e.g., if not line: break)
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            break # Exit the loop when no more input is available
        except ValueError:
            # This handles cases where map(int, line.split()) fails,
            # e.g., if a line is empty or contains non-integer values.
            # Depending on problem constraints, you might just want to break.
            break
    ```
    This modification ensures the program correctly processes all given input pairs as described.

2.  **Remove `casos` Variable:** With the updated input loop, the `casos` variable and the `while i <= casos:` condition are no longer needed and should be removed, simplifying the code.

By implementing the suggested changes to input handling, the program will correctly process the input stream and leverage its accurate mathematical logic to produce the expected output for all test cases.
