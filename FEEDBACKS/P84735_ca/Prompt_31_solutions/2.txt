### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires reading pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`). For each pair, the program must calculate and output the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be prefixed with a case number, starting from 1.

**Solution Approach in the Provided Code:**
The Python program attempts to solve this problem by:
1.  Reading an initial integer `casos`, presumably the total number of test cases.
2.  Iterating `casos` times using a `while` loop, with `i` as the case counter.
3.  Inside the loop, reading a pair of integers `a` and `b`.
4.  Calculating `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`.
5.  Printing the result in the specified format `"#{} : {}".format(i, x)`.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a well-known and correct way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` (for positive `a` and `b`). This formula effectively performs `ceil(a / b) * b`.
*   **Clarity:** The variable names (`a`, `b`, `x`, `casos`, `i`) are clear and descriptive.
*   **Efficiency:** The calculation of `x` is a direct arithmetic operation, making it very efficient (constant time per test case).
*   **Output Format:** The output format `"#{} : {}".format(i, x)` correctly matches the specified requirements for case numbering and value presentation.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Input Handling (Primary Issue):** The most significant weakness, and the likely reason for the "Wrong Answer," is the misinterpretation of the input specification. The problem states, "L'entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," which implies reading input pairs until the end-of-file (EOF) is reached, *not* by first reading a fixed number of test cases. The current code expects an initial integer `casos` which is not part of the problem's input description. When the judge system provides input without this initial `casos` value, the program will likely crash (e.g., trying to convert a non-integer string to `int`) or process input incorrectly, leading to a "Wrong Answer" verdict.
*   **Dependency on `casos`:** The entire loop structure is dependent on `casos`, which is not a valid input according to the problem.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Input Reading for EOF:** The program should be modified to read pairs of `a` and `b` continuously until there is no more input. In Python, this is typically done with a `try-except EOFError` block within a `while True` loop:

    ```python
    i = 1 # Initialize case counter
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            break # Exit loop when no more input
        except ValueError:
            # Handle cases where input might not be two integers,
            # though for competitive programming, input format is usually guaranteed.
            break
    ```

    Alternatively, if the input is guaranteed to have the correct format until EOF, a simpler approach could be:
    ```python
    import sys

    i = 1
    for line in sys.stdin:
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    ```

2.  **Remove Unnecessary `casos` Variable:** Since the input does not specify a fixed number of cases, the `casos = int(input())` line should be removed.

By implementing these changes, the program will correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement and leverage its already correct mathematical logic to produce the right answer.
