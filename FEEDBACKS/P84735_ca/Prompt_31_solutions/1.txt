### Feedback for Program: "Múltiple més petit"

**Problem Summary:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, it must calculate and output the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1, e.g., `#1 : result`.

**Solution Approach:**
The program correctly identifies the mathematical approach to solve this problem. To find the smallest multiple of `b` that is `>= a`, one can use the ceiling division concept. If `a` is a multiple of `b`, then `x = a`. Otherwise, `x` is the next multiple of `b` after `a`. This can be efficiently computed using the formula `x = ((a + b - 1) // b) * b`. This formula effectively calculates `ceil(a / b) * b` using integer arithmetic, which is suitable for positive integers `a` and `b`.

**Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly solves the problem for given `a` and `b` values. It handles cases where `a` is already a multiple of `b` as well as when it's not.
    *   **Efficiency:** The calculation for each pair `(a, b)` involves a constant number of arithmetic operations, making the solution very efficient per test case.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The program adheres to the specified output format `#{} : {}` for printing the case number and the result.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is likely how the program reads input. The problem description states, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b," which typically implies reading pairs of numbers until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached.
        However, your program starts by `casos = int(input())`, expecting the first line to be an integer indicating the *total number of test cases*. This mismatch means the program will try to interpret the `a` value of the first actual `(a, b)` pair as the number of cases, leading to incorrect parsing of subsequent input lines or premature termination, thus causing a "Wrong Answer".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust Input Reading for EOF:** Modify the input loop to continuously read pairs of `a` and `b` until there is no more input (EOF). A common pattern for this in Python, especially in competitive programming environments like Jutge.org, is to iterate over `sys.stdin` or use a `while True: try-except EOFError:` block.

    *Example of corrected input handling:*

    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1  # Initialize case counter
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Each line from standard input is a new pair
        a, b = map(int, line.split())

        # Apply the correct mathematical formula
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b

        # Print the result in the specified format
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
        case_num += 1 # Increment case counter for the next pair
    ```

By making this change to how the program reads its input, the correct mathematical logic and output formatting will be applied to all provided test cases, likely resolving the "Wrong Answer".
