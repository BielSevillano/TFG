The provided Python program is intended to solve the "Múltiple més petit" problem. However, the other possible solutions given are written in C++ and appear to address a completely different problem (finding the `k` most frequent words from a list). Therefore, this feedback will focus solely on the Python program in the context of the "Múltiple més petit" problem.

### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

*   **Problem:** The task is to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b ≥ 1`). For each pair, the program must calculate and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `x` is also a multiple of `b`. The output for each case should be formatted with a case number.

*   **Solution Approach:** The program first reads an integer `casos`, assuming it represents the total number of test cases. It then enters a loop that runs `casos` times. In each iteration, it reads `a` and `b`. The core of the solution is the calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This is a standard and efficient mathematical formula to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division. Finally, it prints the result in the format `#case_number : x`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is a robust and widely accepted method for finding the smallest multiple of `b` greater than or equal to `a` for positive integers `a` and `b`. Given the problem constraints (`a, b` are natural numbers, `b ≥ 1`), this calculation is perfectly suitable.
    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The code is very clean, concise, and easy to read. Variable names are intuitive.
    *   **Efficiency:** The calculation is a direct arithmetic operation, making it highly efficient (O(1) complexity per test case).
    *   **Pythonic Input/Output:** Uses `map(int, input().split())` for efficient parsing of space-separated integers and f-string-like formatting with `.format()` for output.

*   **Weaknesses (Potential Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Input Format Mismatch:** The most likely reason for a "Wrong Answer" verdict on a platform like Jutge.org, given the problem description, is an incorrect assumption about the input format. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b amb b ≥ 1." typically implies that `a` and `b` pairs are provided on separate lines and should be read until the End-Of-File (EOF). The current code, however, assumes the *first line* of input contains an integer `casos` indicating the number of test cases. If the actual input does not start with a `casos` integer (e.g., it starts directly with `10 3`), then `casos = int(input())` will attempt to parse the first `a` (or `a b`) as the number of cases. This will inevitably lead to incorrect parsing, `ValueError`, or misinterpretation of the input, resulting in a "Wrong Answer".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling (Critical):** If the input format dictates reading pairs until EOF, the input loop should be adjusted. Replace the initial `casos = int(input())` and `while i <= casos:` loop with a `while True` loop that handles EOF gracefully.

    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            # If the line might be empty before EOF, add a check
            if not line.strip(): # Handles empty lines gracefully
                break
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError: # Catches end-of-file condition
            break
        except ValueError: # Catches errors if a line can't be parsed into two integers
            # This might indicate an unexpected input format or an empty line.
            break
    ```
    If, however, the problem description for "Múltiple més petit" *does* implicitly guarantee `casos` on the first line (which is less common for this phrasing on some platforms but possible), then the current input structure is fine, and the "Wrong Answer" would stem from another very subtle issue (e.g., extreme values, output precision, or an unusual definition of "natural numbers" or "multiples", which is less probable).

2.  **Verify Problem Statement (External Context):** Double-check the exact input/output conventions for problems on Jutge.org, especially for problems with "sequence of pairs" input phrasing. It's crucial to distinguish between problems that explicitly state the number of test cases first and those that expect reading until EOF.

*(Note: The provided C++ solutions seem to be for a problem entirely different from "Múltiple més petit", specifically one involving word frequency counting and sorting. They are not relevant to debugging this Python code for the stated problem.)*
