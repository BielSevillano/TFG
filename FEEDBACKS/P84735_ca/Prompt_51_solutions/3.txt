### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

#### 1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a program that, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), finds and prints the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

**Solution Approach:** The provided Python program addresses this problem by reading the number of test cases first, then iterating through each pair `(a, b)`. For each pair, it calculates `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is a common and efficient way to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division.

#### 2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness of Logic:** The core mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is perfectly correct for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This formula handles cases where `a` is already a multiple of `b` (e.g., `a=9, b=3` -> `x=9`) and where it's not (e.g., `a=10, b=3` -> `x=12`).
*   **Efficiency:** The solution is highly efficient, performing a constant number of arithmetic operations (`O(1)`) for each test case.
*   **Readability:** The code is concise, clear, and easy to understand.
*   **Input/Output Handling:** It correctly handles multiple test cases and formats the output as specified (case number followed by the result).
*   **Robustness:** Python's arbitrary-precision integers prevent overflow issues, and the problem constraint `b >= 1` avoids division by zero.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **"Wrong Answer" Discrepancy:** Given the problem description provided, the Python code appears to be entirely correct and optimal. The "Wrong Answer" status is highly unusual for such a robust and standard solution to this specific problem. This strongly suggests a potential mismatch:
    *   The Python code might have been submitted for a different problem than the "Múltiple més petit" problem described here.
    *   The provided "other possible solutions" (which are C++ implementations for a "K most frequent words" problem) further support the idea that there might be a confusion regarding the actual problem being tested. If the Python code was indeed submitted for the "K most frequent words" problem, then it is fundamentally incorrect for that problem.
    *   If, however, the problem description *is* accurate, then any "Wrong Answer" would point to very subtle and obscure edge cases not covered by typical test suites, or an issue with the testing environment itself.

#### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Verify Problem Statement:** The most critical suggestion is to confirm that the Python code was submitted for the "Múltiple més petit" problem as described. If it was intended for the "K most frequent words" problem (as implied by the C++ solutions provided for reference), then a completely different algorithm and implementation strategy would be required.
*   **No Improvement Needed (if problem statement is accurate):** If the problem *is* "Múltiple més petit", the current Python code is already highly optimized and correct. There are no significant algorithmic or code structure improvements to suggest.
*   **Edge Case Review (if "Wrong Answer" persists for the stated problem):** In the extremely unlikely event that the problem statement is accurate and a "Wrong Answer" persists, one might review very specific edge cases such as:
    *   `a = 1, b = 1` -> `x = 1`
    *   `a = b` (e.g., `a = 5, b = 5`) -> `x = 5`
    *   Large values of `a` and `b` (though Python handles this well).
    However, these cases are covered by the current formula.

**Conclusion:** The Python code effectively solves the problem "Múltiple més petit" as described. The "Wrong Answer" likely stems from a mismatch between the problem statement given for this feedback and the actual problem the code was tested against. Assuming the problem statement is correct, the solution is excellent.
