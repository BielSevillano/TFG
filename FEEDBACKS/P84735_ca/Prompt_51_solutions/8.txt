### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to find the smallest natural number `x` for given `a` and `b` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b` (i.e., `x = m * b` for some natural number `m`). Your program uses a common and efficient mathematical formula: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly calculates the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive `a` and `b`. The program then iterates through a given number of test cases, applying this formula and printing the result in the specified format.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Formula (for most cases):** The formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is a mathematically sound way to solve the problem for a wide range of inputs, especially when `a` is a positive natural number.
    *   **Efficiency:** The solution is highly efficient, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each pair `(a, b)`.
    *   **Readability:** The code is concise, clear, and easy to understand.
    *   **Correct Output Format:** The output is correctly formatted as `"#{} : {}"`.

*   **Weaknesses (Cause of "Wrong Answer"):**
    The "Wrong Answer" verdict strongly suggests a subtle issue, most likely related to the definition of "natural number" within the problem statement, specifically for the multiplier `m` in `x = mb`.
    *   The standard interpretation of "natural numbers" can sometimes include `0` (`{0, 1, 2, ...}`) or exclude `0` (`{1, 2, 3, ...}`).
    *   Your current formula correctly outputs `0` when `a` is `0` (e.g., for `a=0, b=5`, it calculates `(0 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 4 // 5 * 5 = 0`). In this case, `x=0` is indeed `>= a` (`0 >= 0`) and `x = m * b` for `m=0`.
    *   However, if the problem implicitly requires `m` to be a *positive* natural number (i.e., `m \in \{1, 2, 3, ...\}`), then `x` cannot be `0`. In this specific scenario, if `a=0`, the smallest `x` that is `>= 0` and a multiple of `b` (with `m >= 1`) would be `b` (i.e., `m=1`). This discrepancy in how `0` is handled when `a=0` is the most probable reason for the "Wrong Answer".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To address the potential ambiguity regarding "natural m" and `a=0`, you should consider adding a special case for when `a` is `0`. If the platform expects `m >= 1`, then `x` cannot be `0`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
casos = int(input())
i = 1

while i <= casos:
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Special handling for a = 0
    # If 'm' in 'x = mb' must be a positive natural number (m >= 1),
    # then when a = 0, the smallest x that is >= 0 and a multiple of b
    # (with m >= 1) is 'b' itself (for m = 1).
    if a == 0:
        x = b
    else:
        # Standard formula for a > 0
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
    print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
    i += 1
```

This revised code specifically handles the `a=0` case to output `b`, while keeping the efficient and correct formula for all other `a > 0` inputs. This is the most common resolution for "Wrong Answer" verdicts on this type of problem when the direct mathematical formula is used.
