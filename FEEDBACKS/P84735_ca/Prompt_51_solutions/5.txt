Here's a feedback text for the provided program:

### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires finding the smallest natural number `x` for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`) such that `x` is a multiple of `b` and `x` is greater than or equal to `a`.

The provided Python program approaches this problem by reading pairs `a` and `b` and calculating `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly implements the mathematical concept of `ceil(a / b) * b` for positive integers, which finds the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant and efficient (O(1)) way to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is at least `a`. This part of the solution is perfectly sound.
    *   **Readability:** The code is concise, clear, and easy to understand.
    *   **Efficiency:** For each input pair, the calculation is performed in constant time, leading to an efficient solution if the input is handled correctly.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly how the program reads input. The problem statement specifies that the input "consists of a sequence of pairs of natural numbers a and b", which typically implies reading data until the End Of File (EOF). However, your program starts by reading an integer `casos` to determine the number of test cases. This mismatch means the program will either misinterpret the first pair `(a,b)` as the `casos` count, or attempt to read beyond the available input, leading to errors.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The most crucial improvement is to correct the input reading mechanism to align with the problem's typical input format (reading until EOF).

1.  **Modify Input Loop:** Replace the initial `casos = int(input())` and the `while i <= casos:` loop with a `while True: try...except EOFError:` block. This structure allows the program to process an indefinite number of input pairs until no more data is available.

    Here's how you can modify your `main` function:

    ```python
    import sys

    i = 1 # Initialize case counter
    while True:
        try:
            line = input() # Read a line from standard input
            a, b = map(int, line.split()) # Parse the two integers from the line
            
            # The core calculation logic remains correct
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            # Break the loop when no more input is available (End Of File)
            break
        except ValueError:
            # Optional: Handle cases where a line might not contain two integers.
            # For competitive programming, input is usually guaranteed to be well-formed,
            # so EOFError is often sufficient.
            break 
    ```
    With this change, your program's solid calculation logic will be able to process the input as intended, and it should yield the correct answer.
