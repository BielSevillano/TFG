The provided Python program correctly solves the problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple). The "Wrong Answer" result strongly suggests that this program was submitted to a different problem on Jutge.org, as the reference solutions provided (which involve `vector<string>`, `sort`, and `frequencies` of words) are for an entirely unrelated problem.

Here's the feedback assuming the problem description "Múltiple més petit" is the intended target:

### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

#### 1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

**Problem:** The goal is to find, for given natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`.

**Solution Approach:** The program implements a direct mathematical formula to calculate `x`. It reads the number of test cases, then for each case, it reads `a` and `b`, calculates `x` using `(a + b - 1) // b * b`, and prints the result in the specified format.

#### 2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness (for "Múltiple més petit"):** The core logic `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a well-known and mathematically sound method to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
    *   If `a` is already a multiple of `b`, `a % b == 0`, then `(a + b - 1) // b` performs `(a-1)//b + 1`. For `a=9, b=3`, `(9+3-1)//3 = 11//3 = 3`. `3 * 3 = 9`. Correct.
    *   If `a` is not a multiple of `b`, `a % b != 0`, then adding `b-1` effectively "pushes" `a` to just before the next multiple of `b`, so integer division `// b` finds the correct quotient, which is then multiplied by `b` to get the desired multiple. For `a=7, b=3`, `(7+3-1)//3 = 9//3 = 3`. `3 * 3 = 9`. Correct.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution is highly efficient. For each pair `a` and `b`, it performs a constant number of arithmetic operations, making it an O(1) solution per test case. The overall complexity is O(N) where N is the number of test cases.
*   **Readability:** The code is concise, clean, and easy to understand. Variable names (`casos`, `a`, `b`, `x`) are clear and directly relate to the problem.
*   **Adherence to Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly produces the output in the format requested by the problem description.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Problem Mismatch (Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The only significant "weakness" is external to the code's quality. Given the problem description for "Múltiple més petit" and the nature of the other provided solutions (which are for a "Most Frequent Words" problem), it's highly probable that this Python code was submitted to the wrong problem on the online judge, leading to a "Wrong Answer." For the problem it *intends* to solve, there are no notable weaknesses.

#### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Verify Problem Statement:** The most crucial suggestion is to ensure that this code is submitted to the correct problem ("Múltiple més petit"). If it is, then the code itself is already optimal and requires no significant changes.
*   **Alternative Logic Explanation (for clarity, not for improvement):** While the current formula is excellent, if one were to explain it more intuitively (though less compactly), it could be broken down using the modulo operator:
    ```python
    remainder = a % b
    if remainder == 0:
        x = a
    else:
        x = a - remainder + b # This is a + (b - remainder)
    ```
    However, the current one-liner `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is more elegant and performant.

**Conclusion:**

The Python program is an elegant, correct, and highly efficient solution for the "Múltiple més petit" problem. The "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly a result of a problem mismatch on the submission platform. If submitted to the correct problem, this code should pass without issues.
