The provided Python program aims to solve the "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) problem.

### Feedback on the Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

*   **Problem:** The task is to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b` is always `1` or greater). For each pair, the program must calculate and print the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as "Case # : x", with case numbers starting from 1.
*   **Solution Approach:** The program employs a common mathematical formula to find the smallest multiple. For given `a` and `b`, it calculates `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula effectively computes `ceil(a/b) * b`, which is indeed the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive `a` and `b`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly solves the problem for positive `a` and `b` (as implied by "natural numbers" and `b >= 1`).
    *   **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The solution is very compact, directly applying the formula. The calculation for each pair `(a, b)` is a constant-time operation, making the overall algorithm highly efficient.
    *   **Correct Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly matches the specified output format, including the case numbering.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling for Jutge.org:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly how the program reads input. The problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b amb b ≥ 1." This typically means the input consists of multiple lines, each containing an `a b` pair, and the program should continue reading until there's no more input (End-Of-File). The current code, however, starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, expecting an initial integer indicating the number of test cases. This initial `int(input())` will fail if the first line actually contains two integers `a b`, or if the input format differs from this expectation.
    *   **Irrelevant Reference Solutions:** The "other possible solutions" provided in the prompt are for a completely different problem (word frequency counting), which is not relevant to analyzing this specific "Smallest Multiple" problem or the Python code provided. Therefore, they have been disregarded in this analysis.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The core logic of your solution is excellent. The main area for improvement is adapting the input loop to the typical Jutge.org problem style where the number of test cases is not explicitly given at the start.

*   **Modify Input Loop to Handle End-Of-File (EOF):**
    Replace the initial `casos = int(input())` and the `while i <= casos:` loop with a `while True` loop that attempts to read a line, processes it, and breaks if reading fails (indicating EOF).

    ```python
    import sys # Import sys for sys.stdin if needed, though input() often handles it.

    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            # Read a line of input
            line = input() 
            # If the line is empty (can happen at EOF or with empty lines in some environments)
            if not line:
                break
            
            # Split the line and convert to integers
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            
            # Calculate the smallest multiple
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            
            # Print the result in the specified format
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            # Catch EOFError, which input() raises when there's no more data
            break
        except ValueError:
            # Catch ValueError if input() reads an invalid line that cannot be split/converted
            # This can also serve as an EOF indicator if input() returns "" instead of raising EOFError.
            break

    ```
    This revised structure should correctly read and process all pairs `a, b` until the end of the input stream, resolving the "Wrong Answer" issue.
