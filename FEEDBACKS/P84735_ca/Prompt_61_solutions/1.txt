## Feedback for Program: Múltiple més petit

### 1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks us to find, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted as "#case_number : x".

The provided Python program employs a standard mathematical formula to calculate `x`: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly determines the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

### 2. Code Analysis

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and efficiently finds the desired smallest multiple. It handles cases where `a` is already a multiple of `b` as well as when it's not.
*   **Conciseness and Readability:** The solution is very compact and easy to understand, directly implementing the efficient calculation.
*   **Correct Output Formatting:** The program correctly formats the output with the case number and the calculated value as `#{} : {}`.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly the way the program reads input. The problem description states: "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b". This phrasing, typical in competitive programming, implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, rather than reading a specific number of test cases first.
    The line `casos = int(input())` assumes the first line of input provides the total number of test cases. If the actual input starts directly with a pair like `10 3`, attempting to convert `"10 3"` to an integer will raise a `ValueError`, or if the input format differs subtly (e.g., `10\n3\n...`), it might misinterpret `a` as the number of cases. This mismatch in input expectation is the most critical flaw.

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Adjust Input Loop for EOF Handling:**
    Modify the input reading mechanism to continuously read `a` and `b` pairs until no more input is available (EOF). This is usually done with a `while True` loop and a `try-except` block to catch the `EOFError`.

    **Example of improved input handling:**

    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            break # Exit the loop when no more input
        except ValueError:
            # Handle cases where input might not be two integers,
            # or if the problem has other termination conditions
            break
    ```
    This change will allow the program to correctly process all input pairs as described.

2.  **Variable Naming (Minor):**
    While `i` is commonly used for loop counters, for a "case number", a more descriptive name like `case_num` or `case_id` could enhance readability, though `i` is perfectly acceptable in this context.

**Note on provided reference solutions:**
The "other possible solutions" provided in the prompt appear to be for a different problem ("Paraules més freqüents" / most frequent words) and are written in C++. They are not relevant to the "Múltiple més petit" problem and were not used in this analysis.
