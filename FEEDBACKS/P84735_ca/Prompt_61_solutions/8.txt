### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

#### 1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks you to find, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is also a multiple of `b`.

The program uses a common and efficient mathematical formula to calculate this value: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula effectively performs a "ceiling division" (`ceil(a / b)`) and then multiplies the result by `b` to get the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

#### 2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Core Logic:** The mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is perfectly correct for solving the problem. It's an elegant and efficient way to compute the smallest multiple of `b` that is at least `a`.
*   **Conciseness and Readability:** The Python code is very concise and easy to understand, directly implementing the logic.
*   **Output Formatting:** The use of `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` follows good practice for formatting output strings and correctly includes the case number as required.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" lies in how the program reads input. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies that the program should read pairs of numbers until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached, rather than relying on a predefined number of test cases on the first line. The line `casos = int(input())` incorrectly assumes that the very first line of input provides the total number of `a, b` pairs to follow. If the input format does not begin with a case count, this will lead to misinterpretation of the input data, either by reading the first `a` value as the case count or by causing a `ValueError` if the first input line contains both `a` and `b`.

#### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

To fix the "Wrong Answer" and correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement, you should modify the input loop. Instead of reading a fixed `casos` count, the program should read input pairs repeatedly until there are no more lines to read (i.e., until EOF).

Here's how you can modify the input loop in Python:

```python
import sys

case_num = 1
for line in sys.stdin: # Reads each line from standard input until EOF
    a, b = map(int, line.split())
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
    case_num += 1

```
Alternatively, for competitive programming platforms where `input()` handles EOF by raising an error, a `try-except` block is often used:

```python
case_num = 1
try:
    while True: # Loop indefinitely
        a, b = map(int, input().split()) # Read a line and split into a, b
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
        case_num += 1
except EOFError:
    # When input() encounters End-Of-File, it raises EOFError,
    # and the program gracefully exits the loop.
    pass

```

By implementing this change, your program will correctly process all input pairs as specified and should produce the correct output for the "Múltiple més petit" problem. The core logic for calculating `x` is already robust and correct.
