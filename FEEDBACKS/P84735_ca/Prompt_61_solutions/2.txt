### Feedback: Múltiple més petit

**1. Summary of the problem and the solution approach:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" requires finding, for each given pair of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`. The program attempts to solve this by directly computing `x` using the formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b`. This mathematical approach correctly determines the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is an elegant and efficient way to calculate the required multiple. It effectively performs a "ceiling division" (`ceil(a/b)`) and then multiplies by `b`, which is the correct mathematical solution for this problem.
    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, directly implementing the derived mathematical solution.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The program correctly formats the output as `"#case_number : x"`, adhering to the problem's specified output style.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" lies in how the program reads input. The problem description states, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b...", which typically implies processing pairs until the End-Of-File (EOF). However, the current code starts with `casos = int(input())`, assuming that the first line of input specifies the *number* of test cases. If the actual input format is a continuous sequence of pairs without an initial count, this line will incorrectly parse the first `a` value as the case count, leading to misinterpretation of subsequent inputs and incorrect results.

**3. Suggestions for improvement:**

To fix the "Wrong Answer" and align the program with the standard interpretation of "sequence of pairs" input for competitive programming platforms (reading until EOF), you should modify the input loop. Instead of reading a fixed number of `casos`, the program should continuously try to read pairs `a` and `b` until there is no more input.

Here's how you can modify the input loop in Python:

```python
import sys

i = 1 # Initialize case counter
for line in sys.stdin: # Read lines from standard input until EOF
    a, b = map(int, line.split()) # Parse a and b from the current line
    
    # Calculate the smallest multiple
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    
    # Print the result with the case number
    print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
    
    i += 1 # Increment case counter
```

This change ensures that the program correctly processes each pair of `a` and `b` provided in the input, assigning an incrementing case number, until the input stream is exhausted.
