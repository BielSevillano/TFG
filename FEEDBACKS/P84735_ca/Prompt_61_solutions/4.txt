### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) asks you to find, for given natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

Your program approaches this problem by directly calculating `x` using an arithmetic formula: `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula effectively computes `ceil(a / b) * b`, which is a standard and efficient way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Code Analysis**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Core Logic:** The formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and correctly solves the problem's core requirement. It works for all valid inputs where `a` is a multiple of `b` and when it's not.
    *   **Efficiency:** The calculation is a constant-time operation for each pair of `a` and `b`, making the solution highly efficient.
    *   **Clarity:** The code is straightforward and uses descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand the intent.
    *   **Output Format (per case):** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` line correctly adheres to the specified output format for each individual case.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** This is the most significant weakness and the likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until there is no more input (End-Of-File or EOF). Your program, however, starts by reading an integer `casos`, assuming it specifies the total number of test cases. This mismatch in input expectation will lead to incorrect behavior or runtime errors on the judge's system. The problem does not provide a leading `casos` integer.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

The primary improvement needed is to adjust how your program reads input:

*   **Read until EOF:** Modify your input loop to continuously read `a` and `b` pairs until the End-Of-File is reached. In Python, this is typically done using a `try-except EOFError` block around your `input()` call.

Here's an example of how you could modify your input loop:

```python
i = 1
while True:
    try:
        line = input()  # Read a line of input
        a, b = map(int, line.split()) # Split the line and convert to integers
        
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
        i += 1
    except EOFError:
        # Break the loop when End-Of-File is reached
        break
    except ValueError:
        # Handle cases where input line might be empty or malformed, then break.
        # This is good practice, though typically problem statements guarantee valid input.
        break
```

By making this change, your program will correctly interpret the input as described in the problem statement and should yield the correct answer, given that your core calculation logic is already solid.
