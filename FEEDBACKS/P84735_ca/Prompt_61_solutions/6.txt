### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" (Smallest Multiple) requires the program to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, it must find and print the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The program should output these results, preceded by the case number, starting from 1.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this by calculating `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This is a well-known mathematical trick to perform a "ceiling division" implicitly, effectively computing `ceil(a / b) * b`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic for `x`:** The core mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is a correct and efficient way to determine the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive `b` and non-negative `a`. This part of the algorithm is sound.
    *   **Conciseness:** The solution for calculating `x` is very compact.
    *   **Output Format (Likely):** The output format `"#{} : {}".format(i, x)` is a common and usually correct way to present numbered cases in competitive programming platforms like Jutge.org, assuming it matches the problem's example (which was not provided here).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Input Reading Loop:** The most significant weakness, and almost certainly the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is how the program reads its input. The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" typically implies reading input until the End-Of-File (EOF) is reached. However, the current code `casos = int(input())` expects an initial integer `casos` indicating a fixed number of subsequent test cases. This mismatch means the program will terminate prematurely or read too much data if the testing system uses an EOF-terminated input stream without an explicit case count.
    *   **Unrelated Reference Solutions:** It's important to note that the provided "other possible solutions" (written in C++) are for a completely different problem (counting word frequencies and sorting them). They are not relevant to solving "Múltiple més petit" and thus cannot be used for comparison or inspiration regarding this specific problem. This feedback focuses solely on the given Python code and its intended problem.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The primary improvement needed is to adjust the input reading mechanism:

*   **Change Input Loop to Handle EOF:**
    Instead of reading a fixed number of `casos`, the program should enter an infinite loop and attempt to read `a` and `b` in each iteration. It should break from this loop when an `EOFError` is encountered.

    Here's how the corrected input reading loop should look in Python:

    ```python
    i = 1
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
            # If the line is empty or just whitespace, it might indicate end of meaningful input
            if not line.strip(): 
                break 
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        except EOFError:
            # End of input stream reached
            break
        except ValueError:
            # Handle cases where input line might not be two integers (e.g., malformed input, or an extra empty line before EOF)
            break
    ```

By making this change, the program will correctly process all pairs of `a` and `b` as specified by the problem, leading to a "Correct Answer" assuming the output format matches the platform's example.
