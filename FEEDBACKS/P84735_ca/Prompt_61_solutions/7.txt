### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks you to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b >= 1`) and, for each pair, find the smallest natural number `x` that is both greater than or equal to `a` and a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

Your program attempts to solve this by directly calculating `x` using the mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is a standard and efficient way to compute the ceiling of `a/b` multiplied by `b`, which correctly yields the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core of your solution, the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`, is mathematically sound and correctly calculates the desired multiple for positive `a` and `b`. This is an elegant and efficient way to solve the problem's central logic.
*   **Clear and Concise:** The Python code is very readable, concise, and directly implements the mathematical solution.
*   **Correct Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case number.
*   **Efficient Input Parsing:** Using `map(int, input().split())` is an efficient way to read multiple integers from a single line.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Input Reading Mismatch (Primary Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The most significant issue, and very likely the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, lies in how your program handles input.
    *   The problem statement specifies: "L’entrada consisteix en una **seqüència de parells de naturals a i b** amb b ≥ 1." This implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until the end of the input (End Of File, EOF).
    *   Your current code, however, starts with `casos = int(input())`, which expects an initial integer indicating the *total number of test cases*. This is a common competitive programming pattern, but it contradicts the problem's input description.
    *   If the judge system provides input as a continuous sequence of `a b` lines without an initial `casos` count, your `int(input())` will either try to parse the first `a` as the number of cases (leading to incorrect loop iterations) or raise an error if the first line doesn't conform to an integer, resulting in a "Wrong Answer" or "Runtime Error".
*   **Irrelevant Reference Solutions:** It appears the provided "other possible solutions" for reference are for a completely different problem ("most frequent words" / "Paraules més freqüents") and are not relevant to "Múltiple més petit." This might indicate an error in the problem description or reference material provided.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The core logic of your program is excellent. The main improvement needed is to adjust the input reading mechanism to match the problem's specification:

*   **Modify Input Handling to Read Until EOF:**
    Instead of reading a fixed number of cases, your program should continuously read `a` and `b` pairs until there is no more input. You can achieve this in Python using a `while True` loop with `try-except EOFError` or by iterating directly over `sys.stdin`.

    Here's an example of how to implement this:

    ```python
    import sys

    case_num = 1
    # Iterate through each line of standard input
    for line in sys.stdin:
        # Check if the line is empty (e.g., if there's an extra newline at the end)
        if not line.strip():
            continue
        
        a, b = map(int, line.split())
        
        # The core logic remains excellent
        x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
        
        print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
        case_num += 1

    ```
    This revised input loop will correctly process each pair of `a` and `b` provided in the input sequence until all input has been consumed, resolving the "Wrong Answer" issue.

No other algorithmic improvements are necessary for the problem, as your current formula for calculating `x` is already optimal.
