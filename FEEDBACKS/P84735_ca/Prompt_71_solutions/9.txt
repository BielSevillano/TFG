### Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary:**
The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks us to read pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`). For each pair, the goal is to find and print the smallest natural number `x` that is greater than or equal to `a` and is also a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

**2. Solution Approach Summary:**
The provided Python program attempts to solve this by:
*   Reading an initial integer `casos` to determine how many pairs of `a` and `b` to process.
*   Using a `while` loop to iterate `casos` times.
*   Inside the loop, it reads each pair `a` and `b`.
*   It calculates `x` using the formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`.
*   It then prints the case number and the calculated `x` in the specified format.

**3. Code Analysis - Strengths:**
*   **Correct Calculation Formula:** The core mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is a well-known and efficient way to find the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` for positive `a` and `b`. This part of the logic is robust.
*   **Conciseness:** The calculation itself is very concise, making the code clean for this specific operation.
*   **Output Format:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly follows the required output format, including the case number.

**4. Code Analysis - Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
The primary weakness, and the likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, lies in the **input handling mechanism**.
*   **Incorrect Loop Condition:** The problem statement "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b" implies that the program should read pairs `a, b` continuously until there is no more input (End-Of-File, or EOF).
*   **Fixed Number of Cases:** The current code `casos = int(input())` assumes that the first line of input will always contain the total number of test cases. This is a common pattern in competitive programming, but it is *not* specified for this particular problem. Instead, the problem expects to read an indefinite sequence of `a, b` pairs. When the judge provides input without an initial `casos` number, the program will either try to convert a line like "10 3" to an integer, causing a `ValueError`, or it will read some other value that leads to an incorrect number of loop iterations.
*   **Reference Solutions:** The reference C++ solutions (though for a different problem, they illustrate the input pattern) confirm this interpretation by typically using a `while (cin >> n >> k)` loop, which continues until EOF.

**5. Suggestions for Improvement:**
To correct the input handling and solve the "Wrong Answer", modify the program to read `a, b` pairs until EOF. In Python, this can be achieved using a `try-except EOFError` block or by iterating over `sys.stdin`.

Here's an example of how to modify the input loop in Python:

```python
import sys

i = 1
for line in sys.stdin: # Reads line by line until EOF
    a, b = map(int, line.split())
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
    i += 1
```
This change will ensure the program correctly processes all input pairs as specified by the problem, resolving the "Wrong Answer".
