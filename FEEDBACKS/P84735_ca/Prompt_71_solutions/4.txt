### Feedback on "Múltiple més petit" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem "Múltiple més petit" asks you to write a program that, for given pairs of natural numbers `a` and `b` (with `b ≥ 1`), finds and prints the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output should be formatted with a case number.

Your solution approaches this by using the mathematical formula `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula correctly calculates the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a` using integer division (`//`).

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Mathematical Logic:** The core calculation `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b` is mathematically sound and efficient for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This formula is robust for the given constraints (`a` natural, `b >= 1`).
*   **Clear Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement correctly adheres to the specified output format, including the case number.
*   **Readability:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Input Handling Mismatch (Most Probable Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The problem description states, "L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b". This phrasing typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` until the end of input (EOF), without an explicit count of test cases given on the first line. Your program, however, starts by reading `casos = int(input())`, assuming the first line of input provides the total number of test cases. If the actual test system uses an EOF-terminated input, your program will either misinterpret the first `a` value as the number of cases or raise an error if no initial integer is provided, leading to a "Wrong Answer".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarify Input Specification:**
    *   **If the number of cases IS provided on the first line:** Your current input handling is correct, and the "Wrong Answer" might stem from a very subtle edge case not immediately obvious, or a misinterpretation of "natural numbers" (e.g., if `a=0` is allowed and somehow breaks the formula, though it seems to work correctly).
    *   **If input is EOF-terminated (more likely based on description):** Modify your input loop to read lines until EOF. Here's how you can do it in Python:

        ```python
        import sys

        i = 1
        for line in sys.stdin: # Reads each line from standard input until EOF
            a, b = map(int, line.split())
            x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
            print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
            i += 1
        ```
        Alternatively, using a `try-except` block for `input()`:
        ```python
        i = 1
        while True:
            try:
                line = input() # Reads a line, will raise EOFError at end of file
                a, b = map(int, line.split())
                x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
                print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))
                i += 1
            except EOFError:
                break # Exit the loop when EOF is reached
        ```

By adjusting the input reading to match the problem's implicit "sequence until EOF" pattern, your program is very likely to pass, given the correctness of its core logic.
