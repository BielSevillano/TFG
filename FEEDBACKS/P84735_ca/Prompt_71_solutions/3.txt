Feedback for "Múltiple més petit" Program

**Problem Description Summary:**
The problem asks for a program that, for each given pair of natural numbers `a` and `b` (where `b >= 1`), finds the smallest natural number `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `x` is a multiple of `b`. The output for each pair should be formatted with a case number, starting from 1.

**Solution Approach in the provided program:**
The Python program employs a direct mathematical formula to calculate `x`. For each input pair `(a, b)`, it computes `x = (a + b - 1) // b * b`. This formula is a common and efficient way to achieve the desired "round up to the nearest multiple" behavior. The program then prints the result in the specified format, incrementing a case counter for each processed pair.

**Analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core mathematical formula `(a + b - 1) // b * b` is perfectly correct for finding the smallest multiple of `b` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This is an elegant and robust solution to the computational aspect of the problem.
    *   **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The code is very compact and performs the calculation with minimal operations, making it efficient. Python's handling of arbitrary-precision integers ensures that the solution works correctly even with large input values for `a` and `b`, without concerns about integer overflow.
    *   **Correct Output Formatting:** The `print("#{} : {}".format(i, x))` statement accurately matches the required output format, including the sequential case numbering.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Input Format Mismatch (Primary Issue):** The main reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly an incorrect assumption about the input format. The line `casos = int(input())` at the beginning of the program expects the first line of input to be an integer indicating the total number of test cases. However, the problem statement ("L’entrada consisteix en una seqüència de parells de naturals a i b") typically implies that the program should read pairs of `a` and `b` sequentially, one pair per line, until there is no more input (End Of File or EOF). This mismatch means the program will either misinterpret the first `a` value as the case count or fail if the first `a` cannot be parsed as a standalone integer, leading to incorrect behavior or a runtime error.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

To resolve the "Wrong Answer," the program needs to adapt its input reading mechanism to continuously read `a` and `b` pairs until the end of the input stream, rather than relying on an initial `casos` count.

**Revised Code:**

```python
import sys # Import the sys module to read from standard input line by line

case_num = 1 # Initialize the case counter
# Iterate over each line provided in the standard input until EOF
for line in sys.stdin: 
    # Optional: Basic check to skip empty lines, though usually not needed for competitive programming
    if not line.strip():
        continue
    
    # Parse the two natural numbers 'a' and 'b' from the current line
    a, b = map(int, line.split())
    
    # Calculate 'x': the smallest multiple of 'b' that is greater than or equal to 'a'.
    # The formula (a + b - 1) // b * b effectively performs an "integer ceiling division"
    # to find the next multiple.
    x = (a + b - 1) // b * b
    
    # Print the result in the specified format: "#<case_number> : <result>"
    print("#{} : {}".format(case_num, x))
    
    # Increment the case counter for the next pair of input numbers
    case_num += 1

```
This revised code addresses the likely input format issue, allowing the program to process all input pairs correctly and produce the expected output for each case.
