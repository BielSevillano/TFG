### Feedback for the Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary:**
The task is to write a program that reads a single natural number `n` (guaranteed to be between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output should follow a specific format, e.g., "3*1 = 3".

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program addresses this problem by first reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`, which is then converted into an integer. It then utilizes a `for` loop that iterates through the integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Inside the loop, it constructs and prints each line of the multiplication table, displaying `n`, the multiplier `i`, and their product `n*i`. The `sep=''` argument in the `print()` function is crucial for ensuring the output matches the required format without any extra spaces.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness and Efficiency:** The program correctly solves the problem and produces the exact required output format, as indicated by its "Accepted" status. For the given constraints (n between 1 and 9), its execution is highly efficient.
*   **Clear Loop Structure:** The `for i in range(1, 11)` construct is a standard, readable, and Pythonic way to iterate from 1 to 10, making the code easy to understand.
*   **Precise Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print()` statement is an excellent practice, especially in competitive programming. It explicitly tells Python not to insert a space between the arguments passed to `print`, ensuring the output matches the exact "N*I = RESULT" format and preventing common "Presentation Error" issues.
*   **Appropriate Input Method:** Using `sys.stdin.readline()` for input is common in competitive programming environments, often favored for its potential performance benefits with large inputs, though not strictly necessary for a single digit here.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Input Readability (Minor):** While `sys.stdin.readline()` is functional, for a simple single-line integer input, `n = int(input())` is generally considered more Pythonic and concise. The `sys.stdin.readline()` method typically includes a trailing newline character, which `int()` handles gracefully, but `input()` removes it automatically.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** As is common in competitive programming where inputs are guaranteed to be valid, the program doesn't include any checks to ensure `n` is indeed an integer or falls within the specified range of 1 to 9. This is not a flaw for this specific context but is worth noting for general software development.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
*   **More Pythonic Input (Optional):** For better readability in scenarios where input performance is not a critical bottleneck, you could replace the input lines with:
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    ```
    This eliminates the need for importing `sys` for just this purpose and is often preferred for its simplicity.
*   **Alternative Output Formatting (Optional):** While `sep=''` works perfectly, Python's f-strings or `.format()` method can offer alternative ways to format output, which some find more readable for complex strings:
    ```python
    # Using f-string (Python 3.6+):
    print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")

    # Using .format():
    print("{}*{} = {}".format(x, i, x*i))
    ```
    These are stylistic choices and do not impact the correctness or efficiency of the current solution.

Overall, the program is a robust and correct solution that demonstrates a good understanding of fundamental programming concepts and attention to output formatting details crucial for competitive programming.
