### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires a Python program to read a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table. The provided solution takes an integer input `n`, then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers `i` from 1 to 9. Inside the loop, it prints the expression `n * i = n*i` using `print()` with `sep=''` to remove default spaces, resulting in an output like `5*1=5`.

**Code's Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Handling:** The line `n = int(input())` correctly reads the integer input as specified.
*   **Appropriate Loop Structure:** Using a `for` loop is an efficient and clear way to iterate through the required multiplication factors.
*   **Correct Arithmetic:** The calculation `n*i` accurately computes the product for each line of the table.
*   **Effective Spacing Control:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print()` function is a good technique to ensure the output format matches the typical "N\*M=P" style without unintended extra spaces.

**Code's Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Loop Range:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is that the `for` loop `for i in range(1, 10):` only iterates for `i` values from 1 up to and including 9. A standard multiplication table typically includes factors up to 10 (i.e., `n * 10`). By stopping at `n * 9`, the program omits the final line of the expected output, leading to an incomplete table. This is a common off-by-one error when defining loop ranges.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Adjust the Loop Range:** To print the multiplication table up to `n * 10`, change the `range()` function to include 10. The `range(start, stop)` function goes up to `stop-1`, so you should use `range(1, 11)`:
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11): # Changed from range(1, 10) to range(1, 11)
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i , sep='')
    ```
    This change will ensure that the loop runs for `i = 1, 2, ..., 10`, producing the complete multiplication table.

2.  **Alternative String Formatting (Optional, for readability):** While `print(..., sep='')` is perfectly valid, consider using f-strings for potentially clearer output construction, especially if the format were more complex:
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This approach directly embeds variables into a string literal, which some developers find more readable.
