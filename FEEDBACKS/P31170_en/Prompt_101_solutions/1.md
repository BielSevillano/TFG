### Feedback on the Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that takes a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) as input and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
The submitted program correctly identifies the core logic: it reads the input number `n`, then uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` for each `i` and attempts to print it.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program successfully reads the input number using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer (`int(x)`), which is a common and efficient way to handle input in competitive programming environments.
    *   **Correct Loop Range:** The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop correctly generates numbers from 1 up to and including 10, covering all required multiplications.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The product `x*i` is calculated accurately in each iteration.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Format Mismatch:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly the output format. Competitive programming platforms are very strict about matching the exact output format specified or implied by the problem. Your program prints a verbose sentence: `"the multiplication of",x,"times",i,"is",x*i`.
        This format does not match the standard output expected for a multiplication table, which is typically `n * i = result` (e.g., `5 * 1 = 5`). The problem statement on Jutge.org, while not providing an explicit output example, implicitly expects a concise format that judges can parse.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adhere to the Expected Output Format:** This is the most critical change. Modify your `print` statement to match the standard multiplication table format. Based on the provided reference solutions and common conventions, an output like `n*i = result` is expected.

    **Example of correct output format:**
    For input `5`, the output should look like:
    ```
    5*1 = 5
    5*2 = 10
    ...
    5*10 = 50
    ```

    To achieve this, you can modify your `print` statement. Here are a few ways, similar to the reference solutions:

    *   **Using string concatenation:**
        ```python
        print(str(x) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(x*i))
        ```
    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):** (Often the cleanest way)
        ```python
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `print` with `sep=''` to control spacing:**
        ```python
        print(x, "*", i, " = ", x*i, sep='')
        ```
        (Note: Python's `print()` function by default adds spaces between arguments. `sep=''` removes these default spaces, allowing you to control them explicitly with your strings, e.g., `" = "` instead of `"="` if a space is needed around the equals sign.)

By adjusting the output format to one of these examples, your program should correctly pass the tests.
