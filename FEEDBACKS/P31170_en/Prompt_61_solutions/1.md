### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`.

The provided program implements a direct approach:
1.  It reads the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer.
2.  It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
3.  Inside the loop, for each multiplier `i`, it calculates the product `n * i` and attempts to print the expression `n * i = product`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core logic for generating the multiplication table is sound. The program correctly iterates from 1 to 10 and performs the multiplication `n * i` for each step.
    *   **Input Handling:** It correctly reads the input number and converts it to an integer, which is essential for mathematical operations.
    *   **Readability:** The code is concise and easy to understand, clearly reflecting the intended computation.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Format Mismatch:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly due to incorrect output formatting, specifically concerning spacing. When `print()` is called with multiple arguments separated by commas (e.g., `print(n, "*", i, "=", n * i)`), Python by default inserts a single space between each argument.
        *   This means the current output for `n=2, i=1` would be `2 * 1 = 2` (with spaces around the `*` and `=` symbols).
        *   Most online judges, including Jutge.org, are very strict about exact output formatting. The problem likely expects a different spacing pattern, such as `2*1 = 2` (no spaces around `*`, one space around `=`), or even `2*1=2` (no spaces at all, except perhaps a space before `=`). The default behavior of `print()` introduces extra spaces that are not expected.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To resolve the "Wrong Answer" and ensure the output matches the required format, you need to control the spacing more precisely. Here are a few ways to achieve this:

1.  **Using `sep=''` with `print()` (Recommended for minimal change):**
    You can use the `sep=''` argument in the `print()` function to remove the default spaces between arguments. You then explicitly add spaces where they are desired within string literals.
    ```python
    import sys
    	
    n = sys.stdin.readline()
    n = int(n)
    
    for i in range(1,10+1) :
    	# This prints "N*I = RESULT"
    	print(n, "*", i, " = ", n * i, sep='') 
    ```
    This would output `2*1 = 2` for example.

2.  **String Concatenation:**
    Build the entire output string using string concatenation, ensuring full control over every character and space. Remember to convert numbers to strings using `str()`.
    ```python
    import sys
    	
    n = sys.stdin.readline()
    n = int(n)
    
    for i in range(1,10+1) :
    	print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n * i))
    ```
    This also outputs `2*1 = 2`.

3.  **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**
    F-strings offer a very readable and efficient way to format strings.
    ```python
    import sys
    	
    n = sys.stdin.readline()
    n = int(n)
    
    for i in range(1,10+1) :
    	print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This too outputs `2*1 = 2`.

By implementing one of these suggestions, you will ensure that the program's output format precisely matches the problem's requirements, which should lead to a "Correct Answer". Always pay close attention to the exact output format (including spaces, newlines, and punctuation) when solving problems on online judges.
