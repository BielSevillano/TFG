### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The typical interpretation of a multiplication table involves showing `n * i = product` for `i` ranging from 1 to 10.

The submitted program reads the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`, converts it to an integer, and then uses a `for` loop to iterate through values from 0 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it prints the multiplication expression `n * i` along with its result.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input as a string and converts it to an integer (`x = int(x)`), which is essential for mathematical operations.
*   **Appropriate Loop Structure:** Using a `for` loop is an effective and concise way to iterate through the multiples and generate each line of the table.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `x*i` is performed correctly to find the product.

**Weaknesses (leading to "Wrong Answer"):**
*   **Incorrect Range for Multiplication:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is likely the use of `range(11)`. This generates numbers from 0 to 10. A standard multiplication table typically starts from 1, not 0. Therefore, the program prints an unnecessary line for `n * 0 = 0`, and the problem implicitly expects `n * 1` through `n * 10`.
*   **Output Spacing:** While not explicitly defined in the problem description, competitive programming judges often have strict requirements for exact output formatting, including spacing. The `print(x , "*" , i , "=" , x*i)` statement uses default spaces between arguments, which might not precisely match the expected format (e.g., `n*i = result` vs. `n * i = result`). While this is a secondary concern, it can lead to "Wrong Answer" if the judge expects a different spacing.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Adjust the Loop Range:** To align with the standard multiplication table (1 to 10), change the loop to `for i in range(1, 11):`. This will ensure the program starts multiplying from 1 and ends at 10.

2.  **Control Output Spacing Precisely:** To avoid potential issues with output format and for better readability, explicitly control the spacing. Here are a few ways:
    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):** This is often the most readable and preferred method.
        ```python
        print(f"{x} * {i} = {x*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:**
        ```python
        print("{} * {} = {}".format(x, i, x*i))
        ```
    *   **Using `sep=''` with `print` for specific spacing:** If the exact output `n*i = product` (without spaces around `*` and `=`) is desired, or if specific spacing needs to be maintained.
        ```python
        print(str(x) + " * " + str(i) + " = " + str(x*i)) # This provides full control
        # Or, if default print spacing is okay for operators but no extra spaces:
        print(x, "*", i, "=", x*i, sep=' ') # This is the default behavior.
        # If no spaces between arguments and separators needed:
        # print(x, "*", i, "=", x*i, sep='') # This would result in "3*1=3"
        ```
    Considering the common output for such problems, `print(f"{x} * {i} = {x*i}")` (or its `str.format()` equivalent) is usually a safe bet for legible and correctly formatted output with single spaces around operators.

By implementing the suggested changes, especially correcting the loop range, the program should produce the correct output for the problem.
