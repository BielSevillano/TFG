**Feedback for Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
The submitted program takes a straightforward approach: it reads the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`, converts it to an integer, and then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it prints the multiplication expression `n * i = result` for each `i`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The program correctly implements the core logic for generating a multiplication table, iterating through the correct range (1 to 10) and performing accurate calculations (`x * i`).
    *   **Appropriate Loop:** The use of a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)` is an efficient and Pythonic way to handle the fixed number of iterations.
    *   **Input Handling:** `sys.stdin.readline()` combined with `int()` is a valid method for reading and converting integer input.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The primary weakness, and the most probable reason for the "Wrong Answer" status, lies in the output formatting. The `print()` function's `sep=''` argument causes all printed items to be concatenated without any spaces in between. This results in an output format like `N*I=RESULT` (e.g., `5*1=5`). Most competitive programming platforms, especially for basic problems, have very strict output format requirements. Based on common practice and other successful solutions for this problem, the expected format often includes a space before the equals sign, i.e., `N*I = RESULT`. Without this precise formatting, the output won't match the expected solution, leading to a "Wrong Answer."

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To fix the "Wrong Answer" and ensure the output matches the likely required format, modify the `print` statement to explicitly include the necessary space(s). Here are a few ways to achieve the common `N*I = RESULT` format:

1.  **Using f-strings (recommended for readability in modern Python):**
    ```python
    import sys

    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
    ```

2.  **Using string concatenation:**
    ```python
    import sys

    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(str(x) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(x*i))
    ```

3.  **Using `print()` with default separators and an explicit space string:**
    ```python
    import sys

    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        # This explicitly places the space before '=', which is what the other solutions hint at.
        print(x, "*", i, " =", x*i, sep='')
        # Alternative: if "N * I = RESULT" is preferred, remove sep='':
        # print(x, "*", i, "=", x*i)
        # However, "N*I = RESULT" is the more common format from other solutions.
    ```

By making this small adjustment to the output formatting, the program should produce the expected output and pass the tests.
