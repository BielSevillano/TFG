### Feedback for the Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The provided program tackles this problem by:
1.  Using the `easyinput` module to read the integer input `n`.
2.  Defining a function `multiplication(a)` to encapsulate the logic for generating and printing the table.
3.  Inside the `multiplication` function, a `for` loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10.
4.  For each iteration, it prints a single line of the multiplication table. This is achieved using two `print` statements: the first prints `n * i` without spaces and without a newline (`sep=' '`, `end=''`), and the second completes the line by printing ` = ` and the result `n*i` (with a default space between arguments for the second print and a newline at the end).
5.  Finally, the `multiplication` function is called with the input number.

**Code Strengths:**

*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The function name `multiplication` clearly indicates its purpose.
*   **Modularity:** Encapsulating the table generation logic within a function promotes good programming practices by making the code reusable and organized.
*   **Correctness:** The program accurately calculates and prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10, adhering to the problem's requirements. The use of `range(1, 11)` correctly covers the desired range of multipliers.
*   **Input Handling:** It correctly utilizes `easyinput.read(int)` for reading integer input, which is common in environments like Jutge.org.
*   **`sep` and `end` Usage:** The program demonstrates an understanding of the `sep` and `end` parameters in the `print()` function to control output spacing and newlines, which is a useful skill for precise formatting.

**Code Weaknesses:**

*   **Inefficient Printing:** The most significant weakness is the use of two separate `print` statements to construct a single line of output for each entry in the multiplication table. While functional, it's less concise and slightly less efficient than generating the entire line with a single `print` call. The two `print` calls, however, correctly produce the desired output format (`N*M = RES`).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Consolidate Print Statements:** The two `print` calls within the loop can be combined into a single, more efficient, and readable statement. This can be achieved using f-strings (Python 3.6+) or the `str.format()` method, or by carefully constructing the single `print` statement with `sep` and string literals.
    *   **Using f-string (recommended for modern Python):**
        ```python
        # Inside the loop:
        print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:**
        ```python
        # Inside the loop:
        print("{}*{} = {}".format(a, i, a*i))
        ```
    *   **Using a single `print` with `sep=''` and a string literal for ` = `:**
        ```python
        # Inside the loop:
        print(a, '*', i, ' = ', a*i, sep='')
        ```
        This option explicitly places the ` = ` string literal with its internal spaces, then concatenates the numeric values with no additional separators between arguments.

2.  **Add a Docstring:** Including a docstring for the `multiplication` function would improve its documentation, clearly stating what the function does, its parameters, and what it produces.
    ```python
    def multiplication(a):
        """Prints the multiplication table for a given number 'a' from 1 to 10."""
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{a}*{i} = {a*i}")
    ```
