### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The output should display `n * i = result` for a specific range of `i`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`, converting it to an integer, and then iterating through a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it prints `n`, the multiplication operator `*`, the current loop counter `i`, the equals sign `=`, and the product `n * i`.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input as a string and converts it to an integer (`int(x)`), which is essential for numerical operations.
    *   **Loop Structure:** It utilizes a `for` loop, which is an appropriate control structure for iterating a fixed number of times to generate the table entries.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `x * i` is performed correctly for each iteration.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Incorrect Loop Range (Primary Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The `range(11)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 11, meaning `i` will take values `0, 1, 2, ..., 10`. A standard multiplication table typically starts from `1` and goes up to `10`. Printing `n * 0 = 0` is likely not expected by the judge system and causes the "Wrong Answer".
    *   **Output Formatting:** The `print(x , "*" , i , "=" , x*i)` statement uses Python's default `sep=' '` (space) argument for separating the printed items. This results in output like `N * i = N*i` with spaces around the `*` and `=`. While readable, many online judges expect a precise output format, often `N*i = N*i` (no spaces around `*`, single space around `=`). Although not the primary reason for "Wrong Answer" in this case (the incorrect range is), it could lead to "Presentation Error" or "Wrong Answer" if the judge is very strict.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Loop Range:** Change the `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. The correct `range` function call for this is `range(1, 11)`. This will ensure the program prints the multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`, aligning with standard expectations and likely resolving the "Wrong Answer".

    ```python
    # Current code:
    # for i in range(11):
    # Improved code:
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(x , "*" , i , "=" , x*i)
    ```

2.  **Refine Output Formatting (Optional but Recommended):** To ensure exact output format matching, consider using f-strings or the `sep` argument in `print` explicitly. This avoids unexpected spaces.

    *   **Using `sep=''`:**
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(x, "*", i, " = ", x*i, sep='')
        ```
        (This will print `N*i = N*i` with exactly one space before and after the `=` sign, as ` " = "` is a single string argument.)

    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
        ```
        (This is generally the most concise and readable way to control output formatting in modern Python.)

By addressing the loop range, the program should produce the correct output for the multiplication table from 1 to 10. Refining the output formatting will ensure it matches potential strict requirements of the judging system.
