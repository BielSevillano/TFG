This program aims to solve the "Multiplication table" problem.

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and printing its multiplication table. The table should typically show `n * i = product` for `i` from 1 to 10.
The provided program addresses this by:
*   Reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converting it to an integer.
*   Using a `for` loop to iterate `i` from 1 up to and including 10.
*   Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints the expression `n * i = product`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The program correctly implements the core logic. It reads the input, iterates through the required range (1 to 10), and calculates the correct product for each line of the multiplication table.
    *   **Readability:** The code is simple and easy to understand, clearly reflecting the problem's requirements.
    *   **Efficiency:** For a problem of this scale, the solution is highly efficient, involving basic arithmetic and a small loop.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Primary Issue):** The "Wrong Answer" verdict is almost certainly due to a subtle mismatch in the expected output format. The `print(x,"*",i,"=",x*i, sep='')` statement uses `sep=''` to concatenate all elements directly, including the literal `"="`. This results in an output format like `3*1=3`.
        In competitive programming, when the output format is not explicitly specified, platforms usually expect a common convention, often including spaces around operators and the equals sign (e.g., `3 * 1 = 3`) or at least around the equals sign (e.g., `3*1 = 3`). The lack of spaces around the equals sign in your current output is the most probable cause for the "Wrong Answer".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The main improvement needed is to adjust the `print` statement to match the likely expected output format, which typically includes spaces around the equals sign.

Here are a few ways to achieve this, from most flexible to simplest adjustment:

1.  **Using f-strings (Recommended for modern Python):** This offers excellent readability and precise control over formatting.
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
    ```
    This would produce output like `3*1 = 3`.

2.  **Adjusting the `print` arguments with `sep=''`:** If you want to keep `sep=''` to avoid spaces around the `*` operator, you can modify the equals sign string literal itself.
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(x,"*",i," = ",x*i, sep='') # Note the spaces around the equals sign: " = "
    ```
    This would also produce `3*1 = 3`.

3.  **Using `print` with default separator:** If the expected output is `3 * 1 = 3` (with spaces around both `*` and `=`), you can simply remove the `sep=''` argument. The `print()` function's default behavior is to separate arguments with a single space.
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(x, "*", i, "=", x*i) # Default sep=' ' will be used
    ```
    This would produce `3 * 1 = 3`.

Given the common patterns in similar problems and the behavior of many reference solutions, using either option 1 or 2 to ensure spaces around the equals sign is the most likely fix for the "Wrong Answer".
