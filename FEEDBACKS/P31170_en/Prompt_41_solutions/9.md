This program efficiently solves the "Multiplication table" problem by reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires generating and printing the multiplication table for a given single-digit integer `n`. The program tackles this by:
1.  Reading the input number `n` from standard input.
2.  Converting the input string to an integer.
3.  Using a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
4.  Inside the loop, it prints each multiplication line in the format `n*i = result`, where `i` is the current multiplier.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The code correctly implements the logic to generate the multiplication table from 1 to 10 and produces the expected output format (as confirmed by "Accepted" status).
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is concise and easy to understand, even for beginners. The loop structure and print statement are straightforward.
*   **Idiomatic Loop:** Using `for i in range(1, 11)` is the standard and most Pythonic way to iterate through a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10.
*   **Precise Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print` function is effective for controlling spacing, ensuring no extra spaces are added between the literal `*`, `=`, and the numbers, resulting in output like `n*i=result`. This indicates a deliberate choice for the exact output format required.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Input Method Verbosity:** While functional, `import sys` and `sys.stdin.readline()` is slightly more verbose for reading a single line of input compared to the more common and generally preferred `input()` function for interactive console applications.
*   **No Input Validation:** The problem statement guarantees `n` is between 1 and 9. However, in a real-world scenario, adding an `if` condition to check if the input `x` falls within this specified range would make the program more robust against invalid inputs. This is a common omission in competitive programming problems where constraints are guaranteed.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Simplify Input Reading:** For basic console input, using `input()` is generally simpler and more Pythonic than `sys.stdin.readline()`.
    ```python
    # import sys # no longer needed
    x = int(input())
    ```
2.  **Alternative Output Formatting (Style Preference):** While `sep=''` is correct and concise for the problem's implied output, other formatting methods can sometimes be more readable or flexible, depending on the exact desired spacing or complexity of the output string.
    *   **f-strings (Python 3.6+):** This is often considered the most modern and readable way to format strings.
        ```python
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
        ```
    *   **`.format()` method:** A widely used string formatting method.
        ```python
        print("{}*{} = {}".format(x, i, x*i))
        ```
    *   **Default `print` separator (if spaces are desired):** If the problem intended spaces in the output (e.g., `n * i = result`), removing `sep=''` would achieve that default behavior.
        ```python
        # print(x, "*", i, " = ", x*i) # would print with default spaces
        ```
3.  **Variable Naming (Minor):** The problem description and many other solutions use `n`. While `x` is perfectly fine, sticking to `n` might align slightly better with the problem statement.

In summary, the provided program is a well-structured and correct solution to the problem, demonstrating a solid understanding of basic Python programming concepts. The suggestions primarily revolve around minor stylistic choices and standard practices rather than functional corrections.
