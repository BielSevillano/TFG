**Problem and Solution Approach Summary:**

The problem asks to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from `n*1` up to `n*10`. The provided program addresses this by explicitly writing out ten separate `print()` statements. Each statement calculates and outputs one line of the multiplication table, such as `n * 1 = n*1`, `n * 2 = n*2`, and so on.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program successfully reads the integer input `n` using `easyinput.read()`.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** Each `print` statement accurately performs the multiplication `n * i`.
    *   **Immediate Comprehension for Small Scale:** For this specific problem where the table only goes up to 10, the code is very straightforward and easy to understand at a glance, as each output line is explicitly shown.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Scalability and Repetition (DRY Principle Violation):** This is the primary weakness. The code is highly repetitive, with ten almost identical `print` statements. If the problem required the table up to 100 or more, this approach would lead to an excessively long, unmanageable, and error-prone program. It violates the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
    *   **Hardcoded Values:** The multipliers (1 through 10) are hardcoded into each `print` statement, making the code inflexible if the range of the multiplication table were to change.
    *   **Output Format Mismatch (Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The default behavior of Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas, is to insert a space between each argument. For example, `print(n,"*1 = ", n*1)` would likely produce output like `5 *1 = 5` (with spaces around `*1` and `=`). Automated judging systems often expect an exact output format, typically `5*1 = 5` (without the extra spaces). This subtle difference in spacing is a common reason for a "Wrong Answer" verdict, even if the calculations are correct.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Use a Loop for Repetition:**
    The most significant improvement is to use a loop to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10. This makes the code much more concise, readable, and scalable.

    *   **Using a `for` loop (Recommended):** This is generally the most Pythonic and efficient way for a known range.
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        n = read(int)
        for i in range(1, 11): # i will take values 1, 2, ..., 10
            # Print the multiplication line
            # (See formatting suggestions below for the print statement)
        ```
    *   **Using a `while` loop:** An alternative if `for` loops are not preferred, though generally less concise for this type of task.
        ```python
        from easyinput import read

        n = read(int)
        i = 1
        while i <= 10:
            # Print the multiplication line
            # (See formatting suggestions below)
            i += 1 # Increment i for the next iteration
        ```

2.  **Ensure Correct Output Formatting:**
    To prevent "Wrong Answer" due to unexpected spacing, explicitly control how the output string is constructed.

    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):** This is highly recommended for its readability and conciseness.
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:** A good alternative for earlier Python versions or specific formatting needs.
        ```python
        print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, n*i))
        ```
    *   **Using `print()` with `sep=''`:** This tells `print()` not to insert spaces between arguments. Note that you'll need to include the space around the equals sign explicitly in a string.
        ```python
        print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='') # ' = ' includes the required spaces
        ```
    *   **String Concatenation:** Explicitly convert numbers to strings and concatenate them.
        ```python
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n*i))
        ```

**Revised Example (incorporating a `for` loop and f-string for a robust solution):**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
```
This revised approach is more idiomatic Python, efficient, scalable, and addresses the likely cause of the "Wrong Answer" by ensuring precise output formatting.
