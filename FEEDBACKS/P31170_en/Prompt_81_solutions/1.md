### Feedback on "Multiplication table" Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`. The output for each line should typically follow the format `n * i = result`.

The provided program correctly approaches this problem by:
*   Reading the integer input `n` using `easyinput.read`.
*   Using a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive), representing the multiplier `i`.
*   Calculating the product `x = i * n` in each iteration.
*   Attempting to print the equation in the desired format `n * i = x`.

**2. Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Handling:** The program successfully reads the integer input `n`.
    *   **Correct Iteration Range:** The `for i in range(1, 10+1, 1)` loop correctly generates the multipliers from 1 to 10, which is precisely what the problem requires.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The product `i * n` is calculated accurately in each step.
    *   **Logical Structure:** The overall logic of iterating and computing products for a multiplication table is sound.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Formatting - Missing Spaces:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" is very likely the precise output format. The problem often expects spaces around the operators (`*` and `=`) for readability (e.g., `2 * 1 = 2`). Your current code uses multiple `print` calls, each with `end=""`, which concatenates the elements without any spaces in between them. This results in an output like `2*1=2` instead of `2 * 1 = 2`. The `print()` function in Python, when given multiple arguments (e.g., `print(n, '*', i)`), defaults to separating them with a single space. By preventing this default behavior with `end=""`, you're creating a format mismatch with the expected output.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To fix the "Wrong Answer" and ensure the output matches the common expected format, you should adjust how you print the results to include spaces around the operators. Here are a few ways to achieve this:

1.  **Using a single `print` statement with default spacing (Recommended for simplicity):**
    This is the most straightforward fix. Python's `print` function automatically adds spaces between arguments when multiple items are passed to it.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 10+1, 1):
        x = i*n
        print(n, '*', i, '=', x) # This will output "n * i = x" with spaces.
    ```

2.  **Using an f-string (Formatted String Literal):**
    F-strings offer precise control over formatting and are generally very readable.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 10+1, 1):
        x = i*n
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {x}")
    ```

3.  **Using `str.format()`:**
    Another robust method for string formatting, also providing explicit control.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 10+1, 1):
        x = i*n
        print("{} * {} = {}".format(n, i, x))
    ```

Implementing any of these changes will correct the output format, likely resolving the "Wrong Answer" status.
