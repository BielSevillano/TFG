### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`. The provided program addresses this by reading the input number `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`. The solution then explicitly prints each line of the multiplication table, from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`, using separate `print()` statements for each line, and utilizes `sep=''` to control the spacing of the output.

**2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program correctly solves the problem for the given constraints (n between 1 and 9) and produces the expected output format.
    *   **Clarity (for very small, fixed iterations):** For a beginner, each `print` statement clearly shows the specific multiplication it's performing, which might be easy to follow.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print` function correctly handles the spacing between elements to match the required output format.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Scalability and Maintainability:** This is the most significant weakness. If the requirement changed (e.g., print the table up to 20, or allow the upper limit to be input by the user), the code would need manual modification for every single line. This is highly inefficient and prone to errors.
    *   **Repetitive Code (DRY principle violation):** The `print` statement is essentially repeated ten times with only a changing multiplier and result. This is a classic indicator that a loop structure would be far more appropriate.
    *   **Inefficient for Larger Tables:** While acceptable for 10 lines, imagine if you needed to print a table up to 100 or 1000. This approach would become unmanageably long and unreadable.
    *   **Missed Opportunity for Fundamental Concepts:** The program does not demonstrate an understanding of iterative control flow (loops), which is a fundamental concept for handling repetitive tasks in programming.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The primary suggestion for improvement is to utilize a **loop** to automate the repetitive printing of the multiplication table. This will make the code significantly more concise, scalable, and maintainable.

Here are a couple of examples of how this could be done using common Python loop structures, drawing inspiration from the provided reference solutions:

**Using a `for` loop (recommended for a known range):**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
for i in range(1, 11): # Loop from 1 up to (but not including) 11
    print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n * i, sep='')
```

**Using a `while` loop (also effective):**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
i = 1
while i <= 10: # Loop as long as i is less than or equal to 10
    print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n * i, sep='')
    i += 1 # Increment i for the next iteration
```

By implementing a loop, the program becomes much more robust and adaptable, demonstrating a better grasp of programming fundamentals.
