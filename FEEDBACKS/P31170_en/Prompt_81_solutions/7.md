### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**1. Summary of Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program attempts to solve this by:
*   Reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`.
*   Converting the input string to an integer.
*   Using a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10.
*   Inside the loop, calculating the product of `n` and the current iteration number.
*   Printing the multiplication expression and its result for each iteration.

**2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Logic for Iteration and Calculation:** The program correctly uses a `for` loop (`range(1, 11)`) to iterate from 1 to 10, which is the standard range for a multiplication table. It also correctly calculates `x * i` for each step.
*   **Input Handling:** It correctly reads a line from standard input and converts it to an integer, which is suitable for this problem.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Output Format (Primary Issue):** The main reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly the output format. The line `print(x,"*",i,"=",x*i)` uses `print()` with multiple arguments. By default, `print()` separates these arguments with a space (`sep=' '`). This results in output like `5 * 1 = 5` (with spaces around the `*` and `=`). Most online judges require exact output formatting, and based on common practice and other provided solutions, the expected format is typically `N*I = RESULT` (no spaces around the `*` symbol, but one space before and after the `=` symbol).
*   **Dead Code:** The line `2` by itself after `x = int(x)` is a standalone expression that does nothing. It's dead code and indicates a potential typo or an unfinished thought. While it doesn't cause a runtime error, it makes the code untidy.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format:** This is the most critical change to pass the "Wrong Answer". To achieve the common `N*I = RESULT` format (e.g., `5*1 = 5`), you can use f-strings (Python 3.6+) or string concatenation:
    *   **Using an f-string (recommended for readability):**
        ```python
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using string concatenation:**
        ```python
        print(str(x) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(x*i))
        ```
    *   **Using `print()` with `sep=''` and manual spaces:**
        ```python
        print(x, "*", i, " = ", x*i, sep='')
        ```
        (Note: The last two options would produce `5*1 = 5` without a space before the `*` and a space before and after the `=`).

2.  **Remove Dead Code:** Delete the line `2`.

Applying these changes, your improved program would look like this:

```python
import sys as s

x = s.stdin.readline()
x = int(x)
# Removed the '2' line
for i in range(1,11):
    print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}") # Corrected output format
```
