## Feedback on "Multiplication table" Program

**Summary of the problem and solution approach:**

The problem asks for a Python program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program implements this by reading the input `n`, converting it to an integer, and then using a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and attempts to print the multiplication expression along with its result.

**Analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core logic for generating the multiplication table (iterating from 1 to 10 and calculating `n * i`) is fundamentally correct.
    *   **Readability:** The code is concise and easy to understand, clearly reflecting the intended computation.
    *   **Input Handling:** Using `sys.stdin.readline()` followed by `int()` is a valid method for reading integer input.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Primary Issue):** The main reason for the "Wrong Answer" is almost certainly due to incorrect output formatting. When `print()` is called with multiple arguments separated by commas (e.g., `print(x, "*", i, "=", x*i)`), Python inserts a space character between each argument by default. This results in output like `2 * 1 = 2` (with spaces around the `*` and `=` signs). Competitive programming platforms are very strict about exact output matching, so these extra spaces will cause the submission to fail.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

To fix the output formatting and achieve the likely expected result, you need to explicitly control the spacing. Here are a few common and effective ways to do this, consistent with other successful solutions:

1.  **Using `sep=''` in the `print()` function:**
    This tells the `print()` function to use an empty string as a separator between arguments instead of the default space.
    ```python
    import sys

    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(x, "*", i, " = ", x*i, sep='') # Added sep=''
    ```
    This will produce output like `2*1 = 2` (no space around the `*`, but one space before and after the `=` due to the string literal `" = "`).

2.  **String Concatenation:**
    Explicitly build the output string using string concatenation. This gives you precise control over every character.
    ```python
    import sys

    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(str(x) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(x*i))
    ```
    This would also produce `2*1 = 2`.

3.  **Using f-strings (recommended for modern Python):**
    f-strings provide a very clean and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.
    ```python
    import sys

    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}") # Using an f-string
    ```
    This also produces `2*1 = 2`.

Choosing any of these methods will address the output formatting issue and should resolve the "Wrong Answer."
