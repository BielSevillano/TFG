**Feedback for Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The submitted program reads the input number `n` using `easyinput.read()`. It then proceeds to print each line of the multiplication table, from `n * 1` to `n * 10`, using separate `print` statements for each calculation.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The program correctly performs the multiplication operations for each line (n * 1, n * 2, ..., n * 10).
    *   **Readability (for small, fixed range):** For this very specific and small range (1 to 10), the explicit `print` statements are easy to follow for someone new to programming.
    *   **Directness:** It directly addresses each required output line without complex structures.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Repetitive Code (Lack of Scalability/DRY principle):** The most significant weakness is the highly repetitive nature of the code. Each line of the multiplication table is generated by a virtually identical `print` statement, varying only the multiplier (1 to 10). This violates the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle. If the problem required the table up to 20, 10 more lines would need to be added manually, making the code cumbersome and error-prone.
    *   **Output Formatting (Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** The default behavior of Python's `print()` function is to add a space between arguments separated by commas. For example, `print(n, "*1 = ", n*1)` would produce output like `5 *1 = 5` (if n is 5). Based on the "Wrong Answer" result and common competitive programming conventions for multiplication table problems, this introduces extra spaces that are likely not part of the expected output format. The typical expected format is often `n*i = result` or `n * i = result` with very specific spacing. The current code's automatic spacing deviates from these common expectations.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To address the weaknesses and achieve the correct output, here are some suggestions:

*   **Use a Loop for Iteration:**
    The most crucial improvement is to use a `for` loop (or a `while` loop) to iterate through the multipliers from 1 to 10. This makes the code much more concise, readable, and easily scalable.

    ```python
    # Example using a for loop
    from easyinput import read
    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11): # Loops from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        # Print statement with correct formatting goes here
        pass
    ```

*   **Correct Output Formatting:**
    Inside the loop, ensure the output format matches the exact requirements by controlling the spacing. There are several ways to do this:

    *   **Using `sep=''` with `print()`:** This is a concise way to remove the default spaces between arguments in `print()`. You might still need to include desired spaces explicitly in string literals.
        ```python
        # Example using sep='' (similar to some reference solutions)
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep='')
        # This would produce: 5*1 = 5 (no spaces between n and *, or * and i, etc.)
        ```
        If the desired output is `5 * 1 = 5` (with spaces around the operator), you would adjust:
        ```python
        print(n, " * ", i, " = ", n*i, sep='')
        ```

    *   **Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals - Python 3.6+):** This is often the cleanest and most readable way to format strings.
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        # This would produce: 5*1 = 5
        ```
        Or with specific spacing:
        ```python
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")
        # This would produce: 5 * 1 = 5
        ```

    *   **Using String Concatenation:** Manually combine strings and numbers (converted to strings).
        ```python
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n*i))
        # This would produce: 5*1 = 5
        ```

By implementing a loop and carefully controlling the output format, the program will become more robust, maintainable, and will likely pass the "Wrong Answer" test case.
