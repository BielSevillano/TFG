### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. For instance, if `n` is 2, the output should show `2*1 = 2`, `2*2 = 4`, up to `2*10 = 20`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program approaches the problem by first reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converting it to an integer. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the product of `n` and the current loop variable `i`, and prints a descriptive sentence stating the multiplication operation and its result.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core logic for generating a multiplication table is correctly implemented. The program successfully reads the input number, iterates from 1 to 10, and calculates the correct product for each step.
    *   **Looping Mechanism:** The `for i in range(1, 11)` loop is an efficient and correct way to generate the multipliers from 1 to 10.
    *   **Input Handling:** The use of `sys.stdin.readline()` followed by `int()` for type conversion is functionally correct for reading integer input.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Format (Primary Issue - Leading to "Wrong Answer"):** The most critical weakness, and the likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is the output format. Competitive programming problems typically require exact output matching. The current output `print("the multiplication of",x,"times",i,"is",x*i)` is verbose and deviates from the common, concise format usually expected for multiplication tables (e.g., `n*i = result`). For example, if `n` is 2, the program outputs "the multiplication of 2 times 1 is 2", while the expected output is likely "2*1 = 2" or "2 * 1 = 2". This exact mismatch will cause the "Wrong Answer".
    *   **Readability (Minor):** While `sys.stdin.readline()` works, `input()` is generally more idiomatic and concise for simple single-line inputs in Python, as it automatically strips the newline character.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Strict Adherence to Output Format:** This is the most crucial change. Modify the `print` statement to match the standard multiplication table format. Several ways to achieve this efficiently:
    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**
        ```python
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:**
        ```python
        print("{}*{} = {}".format(x, i, x*i))
        ```
    *   **Using `print()` with `sep=''`:** This is good when you want precise control over spacing between elements.
        ```python
        print(x, "*", i, " = ", x*i, sep="")
        ```
    *   **String Concatenation (less ideal for many parts):**
        ```python
        print(str(x) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(x*i))
        ```
    Choose one format and ensure it exactly matches the problem's expected output (including spaces around `*` and `=`).

2.  **Simplify Input Reading (Optional):** For clarity and conciseness in this type of problem, consider using `input()`:
    ```python
    x = int(input())
    ```
    This replaces both `x = sys.stdin.readline()` and the subsequent `x = int(x)`.

By implementing the suggested change to the output format, your program's logical correctness will be recognized, and it should achieve an "Accepted" verdict.
