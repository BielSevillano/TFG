### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (constrained between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program implements a standard and logical approach: it reads the input `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`, then defines a function `taula_de_multiplicar` which uses a `for` loop to iterate `i` from 1 to 10. In each iteration, it calculates the product `n * i` and attempts to print the expression and its result.

**Code's Strengths:**
*   **Clear Structure:** The code is well-organized with dedicated functions (`taula_de_multiplicar`, `main`), which promotes modularity and readability.
*   **Correct Logic:** The `for i in range(1, 11)` loop correctly generates the multipliers from 1 to 10, and the calculation `n * i` is accurate.
*   **Input Handling:** It correctly utilizes `easyinput.read(int)` for receiving integer input, which is common in competitive programming environments like Jutge.org.

**Code's Weaknesses:**
The program received a "Wrong Answer" primarily due to a **subtle output formatting issue**.
In Python, when `print()` is called with multiple arguments separated by commas, it inserts a default space character (`' '`) between each argument.
For example, your current `print(n,'*',i ,' = ', n * i)` for `n=2, i=1` would produce:
`2 * 1  =  2` (with extra spaces around the `*` and ` = `).

The typical expected output format for such problems is very strict, often requiring:
`2*1 = 2` (no spaces around the `*`, and a single space before and after the `=`).
This discrepancy in whitespace is the most common reason for "Wrong Answer" verdicts on problems like this.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
To fix the "Wrong Answer" and ensure the output matches the exact required format, you need to explicitly control the spacing in your `print` statement. Here are a few ways to achieve this:

1.  **Using `sep=''` in `print()` (Minimal change to existing arguments):**
    By setting `sep=''` (separator is an empty string), `print()` will not add spaces between arguments. You then need to ensure any desired spaces are part of your string literals.

    ```python
    def taula_de_multiplicar(n):
        for i in range(1,11):
            # Original: print(n,'*',i ,' = ', n * i)
            # Corrected:
            print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n * i, sep='')
    ```
    *Explanation:* With `sep=''`, the arguments `n`, `'*'`, `i`, `' = '`, `n * i` are concatenated directly. This means `n` is followed by `*` (from the string literal), which is followed by `i`, which is followed by ` = ` (from the string literal), and then `n * i`. This results in the correct `2*1 = 2` format.

2.  **String Concatenation:**
    Explicitly convert numbers to strings and concatenate them with the desired symbols.

    ```python
    def taula_de_multiplicar(n):
        for i in range(1,11):
            print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n * i))
    ```

3.  **f-strings (Python 3.6+):**
    This is a modern and often preferred way to format strings as it's very readable and concise.

    ```python
    def taula_de_multiplicar(n):
        for i in range(1,11):
            print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

4.  **`str.format()` method:**
    An older but still widely used method for string formatting.

    ```python
    def taula_de_multiplicar(n):
        for i in range(1,11):
            print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, n*i))
    ```

Any of these suggested changes will produce the exact output format required by the problem and should resolve the "Wrong Answer" verdict. The `sep=''` approach is the most direct modification to your existing code.
