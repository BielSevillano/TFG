**Feedback for Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**
The problem asks for a Python program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
The provided solution addresses this by first reading the integer input `n`. It then employs a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Inside the loop, it calculates the product of `n` and the current loop variable `i`, and prints the result in the format `n*i = product` for each step of the table.

**2. Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the logic to generate the multiplication table and produces the expected output format, as confirmed by its "Accepted" status.
    *   **Clear Logic:** The use of a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)` is straightforward and clearly indicates the intended iteration from 1 to 10.
    *   **Input Handling:** The `int(input())` function is correctly used to read and convert the user's input into an integer, ready for calculations.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting Verbosity:** The primary area for improvement is how the output line is constructed. Using three separate `print` statements (with `sep=''` and `end=' '` arguments) to build a single line of the multiplication table is unnecessarily verbose. While it achieves the correct visual output, it's less concise and slightly less efficient than common Pythonic approaches for string formatting.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The output formatting can be significantly streamlined and made more Pythonic by combining the print statements. Here are a few recommended ways to achieve the identical output format (`n*i = result`) with better readability and conciseness:

1.  **Using `print` with `sep=''` and careful spacing:** This approach explicitly controls the separator between items and allows precise spacing.
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n * i, sep='')
    ```
    This version directly matches the exact output format produced by the original code.

2.  **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):** This is often considered the most modern, readable, and flexible way to format strings.
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

3.  **Using string concatenation:** This method is explicit about converting numbers to strings before combining them.
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n*i))
    ```

Adopting any of these suggestions would make the code more concise and easier to read without altering its core functionality or correctness.
