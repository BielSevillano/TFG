### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` up to `n * 10`. The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input number `x`, then using a `for` loop to iterate through multipliers, building a single string `table` with each line of the multiplication table, and finally printing this `table` string.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer using `int()`.
*   **Fundamental Loop Structure:** It correctly identifies the need for a loop to generate multiple lines of output.
*   **Arithmetic Calculation:** The multiplication `x * n` is correctly performed.
*   **Output String Formatting (Partial):** The format `N*I = RESULT` with newlines for each entry is generally correct and well-constructed for the lines it does produce.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Loop Range:** The primary issue lies in the `for n in range(1,10):` statement. This loop generates numbers from 1 up to, but *not including*, 10. As a result, the multiplication table is only printed for `n * 1` through `n * 9`, missing the `n * 10` entry, which is standard for a full multiplication table. This is the direct cause of the "Wrong Answer" verdict.
*   **Unreachable Code:** The `if n == 10:` condition inside the loop will never be met because `n` in `range(1,10)` never reaches the value 10. This block of code is redundant and indicates a misunderstanding of how `range()` works or the intended scope of the loop.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Loop Range:** To include the `n * 10` entry, change the loop to iterate up to and including 10. In Python, `range(start, end)` goes up to `end-1`. Therefore, `range(1,11)` should be used:
    ```python
    for n in range(1,11): # This will generate numbers from 1 to 10
        table += str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' +  str(x * n) + '\n'
    ```
2.  **Remove Unnecessary Code:** The `if n == 10:` block is unreachable and should be removed. Its logic for appending the last line is also slightly different (no `\n`), which would cause further issues if it were ever reached. The corrected loop range makes this conditional logic entirely unnecessary as all lines are generated consistently.
3.  **Simplify Output (Optional but Recommended):** For line-by-line output, it's often simpler and more efficient to print directly within the loop rather than building a large string and printing it once. This avoids potential memory issues for very large outputs and simplifies the code.
    ```python
    import sys

    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)

    for n in range(1, 11):
        print(str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' + str(x * n))
    ```
    This approach will automatically add a newline after each `print` call.
