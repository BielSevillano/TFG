This feedback analyzes your Python program for generating a multiplication table.

### 1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach

**Problem:** The task is to read a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The output for each line should follow a specific format, typically `n*i = n*i`.

**Solution Approach:** Your program attempts to solve this by:
1.  Reading the input number using `sys.stdin.readline()`.
2.  Iterating through numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
3.  Inside the loop, it calculates the product `(input number) * (current loop number)` and prints the components (`input number`, `*`, `current loop number`, `=`, `product`).

### 2. Code Analysis

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Loop Range:** The `for n in range(1, 10 + 1)` correctly sets up the loop to iterate from 1 to 10, which is precisely what's needed for a multiplication table up to 10.
*   **Correct Multiplication Logic:** The expression `int(x) * n` accurately calculates the product for each line of the table.

**Weaknesses (Reasons for "Wrong Answer"):**
*   **Input Handling:**
    *   `sys.stdin.readline()` reads the input including the newline character (`\n`). While `int("5\n")` might work in some Python versions by stripping whitespace, it's not robust. It's best practice to explicitly strip whitespace using `.strip()` before converting to an integer.
    *   The conversion `int(x)` is performed twice in each loop iteration, which is redundant and slightly inefficient. The input should be converted to an integer once and stored in a variable before the loop begins.
*   **Output Formatting (Most Likely Cause of "Wrong Answer"):** This is the most critical issue. Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas, inserts a space between each argument by default.
    *   Your code `print (int(x),'*',n,'=',int(x)*n)` will produce output like `5 * 1 = 5` (with spaces around the `*` and `=` signs).
    *   However, competitive programming platforms typically expect an exact output format, such as `5*1 = 5` (no spaces around `*`, but a space around `=`). The discrepancy in spacing is a common reason for "Wrong Answer".
*   **Variable Naming:** While not an error, using `n` as the loop variable when the input is conceptually also `n` can be a little confusing. It's often clearer to use `i` or `multiplier` for the loop counter and a descriptive name like `num` for the input.

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Robust and Efficient Input Reading:**
    *   Read the input once outside the loop.
    *   Use `.strip()` to remove the newline character.
    *   Convert the stripped string to an integer once.
    ```python
    import sys

    # Read the line, strip whitespace (like newline), and convert to integer
    num = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    ```
    (Alternatively, `num = int(input())` is simpler if `sys` isn't strictly required for reading from stdin.)

2.  **Precise Output Formatting:**
    To achieve the typical output format `N*i = PRODUCT` (e.g., `5*1 = 5`), modify your `print` statement. Here are a few recommended ways:
    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):** This is generally the most readable and preferred modern approach.
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{num}*{i} = {num*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:**
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print("{0}*{1} = {2}".format(num, i, num*i))
        ```
    *   **Using `print()` with `sep=''` and explicit spaces:** This is how some of the reference solutions manage it.
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(num, '*', i, ' = ', num * i, sep='')
        ```
        This particular `sep=''` usage will join all elements directly, but by including `' = '` as a single string, it achieves the desired space.

3.  **Improve Variable Naming for Clarity:**
    ```python
    import sys

    num = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip()) # Input number
    
    for i in range(1, 11): # Loop variable renamed to 'i' for clarity
        print(f"{num}*{i} = {num*i}") # Or your preferred formatting method
    ```

By implementing these changes, your program should produce the correct output format and pass the test cases.
