### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The provided program addresses this by reading the input `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`, converting it to an integer, and then iterating from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints a descriptive line for each multiplication.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

1.  **Correct Logic:** The core logic of the program is sound. It correctly reads the input number and iterates through the numbers 1 to 10 to calculate the multiplication table entries.
2.  **Appropriate Loop Usage:** The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop is correctly used to generate the multipliers from 1 up to and including 10.
3.  **Clear Variable Names:** The variable `x` for the input number and `i` for the multiplier are clear and understandable in this context.

**Weaknesses (Leading to "Wrong Answer"):**

1.  **Incorrect Output Format:** The most critical weakness, and almost certainly the reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is the output format. Competitive programming platforms are very strict about matching the expected output exactly.
    *   Your program prints: `"the multiplication of X times Y is Z"`
    *   Standard multiplication table problems typically expect a format like: `"X*Y = Z"`, `"X * Y = Z"`, or `"X*Y=Z"`.
    The verbose phrasing and extra words in your output do not match the implicit simple format expected by the judge system.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format (High Priority):** This is the most important change. You need to adjust the `print` statement to match the standard expected format. Here are a few common ways to achieve this, based on the reference solutions:
    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):** This is often the most readable and concise:
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:**
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print("{}*{} = {}".format(x, i, x*i))
        ```
    *   **Using `print` with `sep=''`:** This removes the default spaces added by `print` when multiple arguments are provided, allowing precise control:
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(x, "*", i, " = ", x*i, sep='')
        ```
        (This will output `X*I = Z`)

2.  **Consider using `input()` for simpler input:** While `sys.stdin.readline()` is perfectly valid and sometimes preferred for large inputs, for a single integer `n`, `input()` is often simpler and more idiomatic Python, removing the need to import `sys`.
    ```python
    x = int(input())
    ```

By fixing the output format, your program should correctly pass the test cases. The underlying logic is already correct.
