Here's a feedback text for your program:

**Feedback for Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Summary of Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from `n*1` to `n*10`. Your solution approaches this by reading the input `n` and then explicitly writing out ten separate `print()` statements, one for each line of the multiplication table. Each `print()` statement calculates and displays `n` multiplied by the numbers 1 through 10.

**2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer input `n` using `easyinput.read(int)`.
    *   **Correct Calculations:** Each multiplication operation (e.g., `n*1`, `n*2`, ..., `n*10`) is correctly calculated.
    *   **Completeness:** The program covers all required multiplication entries from 1 to 10.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting (Primary Reason for "Wrong Answer"):** The main issue leading to the "Wrong Answer" is likely the output format. When you use multiple arguments in Python's `print()` function separated by commas (e.g., `print(n, "*1 = ", n*1)`), Python inserts a default space character (`' '`) between each argument. This results in output like `5 *1 = 5` (if `n` is 5) instead of the typically expected `5*1 = 5`. The extra spaces around the `*` and `=` symbols do not match the precise output format required by the problem.
    *   **Repetitive Code:** The code is highly repetitive, with ten almost identical `print()` statements. While this works for a fixed range of 1 to 10, it's not a scalable or elegant solution. If the problem required printing the table up to 100, the code would become very long and difficult to manage. This is a common indicator that a loop should be used.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Fix Output Formatting:** This is crucial to get a "Correct Answer". You need to control the spacing within your print statements. Here are a few ways to achieve the correct format (e.g., `5*1 = 5`):
    *   **Using `sep=''` in `print()` (Recommended for minimal changes):**
        By adding `sep=''` to your `print()` calls, you tell Python not to insert any spaces between the printed arguments.
        ```python
        print(n, '*1 = ', n*1, sep='')
        # Example output for n=5: 5*1 = 5
        ```
    *   **Using f-strings (Modern Pythonic way):**
        f-strings allow you to embed expressions directly into string literals, giving you precise control over the output.
        ```python
        print(f"{n}*{1} = {n*1}")
        # Example output for n=5: 5*1 = 5
        ```
    *   **Using string concatenation:**
        You can convert numbers to strings and concatenate them explicitly.
        ```python
        print(str(n) + '*' + str(1) + ' = ' + str(n*1))
        # Example output for n=5: 5*1 = 5
        ```

2.  **Use a Loop for Conciseness and Scalability:** To eliminate the repetitive `print()` statements and make your code more robust, use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. This is a fundamental programming concept for such tasks.

    Here's an example combining the formatting fix with a `for` loop:

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11): # Loop from 1 up to (but not including) 11
        # Using f-string for clear formatting:
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        
        # Alternatively, using print with sep='':
        # print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')
    ```

Implementing these suggestions will not only fix the "Wrong Answer" by correctly matching the output format but also improve the overall quality and readability of your code.
