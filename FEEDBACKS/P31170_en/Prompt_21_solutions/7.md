**Feedback on Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. This typically means printing `n * i = result` for `i` from 1 to 10.

The submitted program attempts to solve this by:
*   Reading the input number `n`.
*   Using a `for` loop to iterate through the multipliers.
*   Inside the loop, it performs the multiplication `n * i`.
*   It uses multiple `print` statements with `sep` and `end` arguments to construct each line of the table.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the integer `n` from the input.
*   **Appropriate Loop Structure:** Using a `for` loop is an excellent choice for iterating a fixed number of times (for `i` from 1 to 10).
*   **Correct Multiplication Logic:** The calculation `(n)*i` correctly computes the product for each line.

**Weaknesses (Reasons for "Wrong Answer"):**
*   **Incorrect Loop Range:** The `for i in range(0, 11)` loop causes the multiplication table to start from `0*n`, which is typically not part of a standard multiplication table (they usually start from `1*n`). This is likely the primary reason for the "Wrong Answer". The expected range for `i` is generally 1 to 10.
*   **Output Formatting Mismatch:** The way the output string is constructed across multiple `print` statements leads to incorrect spacing compared to common expectations.
    *   `print(n ,'*', i, sep='', end=' ')` will print `n*i ` (with a trailing space).
    *   `print('= ', end='')` will print `= ` (with a trailing space).
    *   The combined effect is an extra space between the multiplier `i` and the equals sign `=`. For example, `5*1  = 5` instead of the more standard `5*1 = 5`. The `Wrong Answer` result often indicates a strict requirement for exact output formatting, including whitespace.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To fix the "Wrong Answer" and improve the code, consider the following:

1.  **Correct the Loop Range:**
    Change `range(0, 11)` to `range(1, 11)` to ensure the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 10`.

2.  **Simplify and Standardize Output Formatting:**
    Instead of multiple `print` statements with complex `sep` and `end` arguments, use a single `print` statement with either f-strings, string concatenation, or `print` with `sep=""` for better control over the output format.

    **Recommended (using f-string):**
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11): # Corrected range
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Simplified and correct formatting
    ```

    **Alternative (using print with sep=""):**
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11): # Corrected range
        print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='') # Corrected formatting using sep=''
    ```
    This `sep=''` approach makes `print` concatenate all arguments without adding spaces, which matches the common expected format.

By implementing these changes, the program will produce the correct multiplication table output in the expected format, resolving the "Wrong Answer".
