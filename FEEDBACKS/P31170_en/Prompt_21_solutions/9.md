### Feedback on "Multiplication table" program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The student's program approaches this by:
*   Reading the input number `n`.
*   Using a `for` loop to iterate through multipliers.
*   Inside the loop, calculating the product `n * i`.
*   Printing the expression `n * i = product` for each iteration.
*   Using `sep=''` in the `print` function to ensure no extra spaces are added between the printed components, aiming for a specific output format (e.g., `3*1 = 3` instead of `3 * 1 = 3`).

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Reading:** The line `n = int(input())` correctly reads the integer input.
*   **Appropriate Loop Structure:** Using a `for` loop (`for i in range(1, 10):`) is an efficient and Pythonic way to iterate through a sequence of numbers.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The expression `n*i` correctly computes the product for each step of the table.
*   **Intended Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print` function is a good detail for controlling the output format, likely matching the expected "no-space" format for the `*` and `=` symbols (e.g., `n*i = result`), which is often implicitly required in competitive programming problems.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Incorrect Output Range:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is the loop's range. The `range(1, 10)` function generates numbers from 1 up to, but not including, 10. This means the program prints the multiplication table for `n * 1` through `n * 9`.
    *   Referring to typical multiplication table expectations and the provided "other possible solutions," the table should extend up to `n * 10`. The program is missing the last line of the table (`n * 10 = ...`). This is a common "off-by-one" error when using `range()`.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

*   **Correct the Loop Range:** To include the multiplication by 10, the `range` function should be adjusted to `range(1, 11)`. This will make the loop iterate for `i` values from 1 up to and including 10.

    ```python
    # Current code:
    # for i in range(1, 10): 

    # Suggested improvement:
    for i in range(1, 11): # This will include 10
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i , sep='')
    ```

*   **Alternative Formatting (Optional, for readability/flexibility):** While `sep=''` works fine for this specific case, for more complex string formatting, f-strings (formatted string literals) or the `.format()` method can sometimes offer better readability and flexibility.

    ```python
    # Using f-string (Python 3.6+):
    # for i in range(1, 11):
    #     print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")

    # Using .format() method:
    # for i in range(1, 11):
    #     print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, n*i))
    ```
    Either of these alternatives would produce the same desired output format (e.g., `3*1 = 3`) without needing the `sep=''` argument. However, for a simple case like this, the current approach with `sep=''` is perfectly acceptable once the range is fixed.
