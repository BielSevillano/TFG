**Feedback for Multiplication Table Program**

This program successfully solves the problem of printing the multiplication table for a given natural number `n`.

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires the program to read a single integer `n` (between 1 and 9) and then print its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.

The provided solution approaches this by:
*   Reading the input `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converting it to an integer.
*   Using a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
*   Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` for each iteration `i`.
*   It then constructs a string in the format `"n*i = n*i"` using string concatenation and prints this string for each line of the table.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and prints the multiplication table according to the problem description, as indicated by the "Accepted" status.
*   **Looping Structure:** The use of a `for` loop (`for i in range(1, 11):`) is an efficient and idiomatic Python way to iterate a fixed number of times, making the code concise and easy to understand.
*   **Clarity:** The logic is straightforward; it clearly reads input, performs calculations within a loop, and prints the results.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Input Method:** While `sys.stdin.readline()` is functional, `input()` is generally more common and user-friendly for reading single lines of input in Python scripts for educational or competitive programming contexts, unless performance for very large inputs is a critical concern (which it isn't here). Many reference solutions use `easyinput.read` or `input()`.
*   **String Formatting for Output:** The string concatenation `str(n) +"*"+ str(i) + " = " + str(n*i)` works correctly but can be less readable and slightly less efficient than modern string formatting methods, especially for more complex output. The temporary variable `s` is also not strictly necessary.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Refine Input Method (if applicable to environment):**
    *   If `easyinput` is the standard for the platform, use `n = read(int)` as seen in many reference solutions.
    *   Otherwise, for typical Python environments, `n = int(input())` is often preferred for simplicity.

2.  **Improve Output Formatting:**
    *   **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):** This is generally the most recommended and readable way to format strings in Python.
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:** A good alternative for broader compatibility.
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, n*i))
        ```
    *   **Using `print()` with `sep=''`:** The `print()` function can take multiple arguments, and `sep=''` prevents the default space separation, providing clean output. This is a very common and efficient approach found in many reference solutions.
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i, sep="")
        ```

Applying these suggestions would make the code even more Pythonic, readable, and align with common best practices for string output. Overall, it's a solid and correct solution to the problem.
