### Feedback on "Multiplication Table" Program

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires reading a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and printing its multiplication table from 1 to 10. Your program addresses this by reading the input `n` using `easyinput.read`. It then uses ten separate `print()` statements to display each line of the multiplication table, from `n*1` up to `n*10`.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Handling:** The `from easyinput import read` and `n = read(int)` correctly handle the input as specified for this problem environment.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The arithmetic for `n*1`, `n*2`, ..., `n*10` is logically correct, producing the right numerical results for each multiplication.
    *   **Completeness:** The program attempts to print all 10 required lines of the multiplication table.

*   **Weaknesses (Reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
    *   **Output Formatting:** The most likely reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is a discrepancy in the output format. Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas (e.g., `print(n, "*1 = ", n*1)`), inserts a space between each argument by default. This leads to an output like `2 *1 = 2` (with an extra space after the number `n`) instead of the typically expected `2*1 = 2`. Competitive programming platforms are very strict about exact output matching.
    *   **Code Duplication (Maintainability):** While not the cause of the "Wrong Answer," repeating the `print()` statement ten times makes the code verbose and less efficient. If the requirement changed (e.g., to print up to 20 or 100), you'd have to manually add many more lines. This approach is prone to errors and hard to maintain.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct Output Formatting:**
    To achieve the precise output format typically expected (e.g., `n*i = result` without extra spaces), you have a few good options:
    *   **Using `sep=''` in `print()`:** This is the most direct fix for your current `print()` structure. By adding `sep=''` to your `print()` calls, you tell Python not to insert any spaces between the arguments.
        ```python
        print(n, '*1 = ', n*1, sep='')
        # This will print "2*1 = 2" if n is 2
        ```
    *   **Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals) or `.format()`:** These methods offer excellent control over string formatting and are generally preferred for cleaner output.
        ```python
        # With f-strings (Python 3.6+)
        print(f"{n}*{1} = {n*1}")
        
        # With .format()
        print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, 1, n*1))
        ```

2.  **Use a Loop for Iteration:**
    A `for` loop is ideal for generating repetitive output like a multiplication table. This significantly reduces code duplication and makes your program more flexible and readable.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)

    for i in range(1, 11): # Loop from 1 up to (but not including) 11, so 1 to 10
        # Using an f-string for concise and correctly formatted output
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

By implementing these suggestions, your code will produce the correct output format and be more robust and Pythonic.
