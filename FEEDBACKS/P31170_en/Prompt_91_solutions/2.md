### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided solution correctly approaches this by defining a function `taula_de_multiplicar` that takes `n` as input. Inside this function, a `for` loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the product of `n` and the current multiplier `i` and attempts to print the result in the format `n * i = product`. The `main` function handles reading the input `n` using `easyinput.read` and then calls `taula_de_multiplicar`.

**Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Logic:** The core logic for generating the multiplication table is sound. The `for i in range(1, 11)` loop correctly covers the multipliers from 1 to 10.
    *   **Clear Structure:** The use of separate functions (`taula_de_multiplicar` and `main`) demonstrates good programming practice by modularizing the code.
    *   **Appropriate Input Handling:** The program correctly utilizes `easyinput.read(int)` for input, which is standard for the Jutge.org platform.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Format Mismatch:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" result is likely an issue with the output format. Python's `print()` function, when given multiple arguments separated by commas, inserts a space between each argument by default.
        For example, `print(n,'*',i ,' = ', n * i)` will produce output like `5 * 1 = 5` (note the extra spaces around `*` and `=` signs). Most online judges require an exact output format, and these extra spaces usually lead to a "Wrong Answer." The expected format is typically `n*i = result` (no spaces around the `*`, and a single space around the `=`).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

To fix the output format and achieve the likely expected format (`n*i = result`), you can modify the `print` statement in the `taula_de_multiplicar` function. Here are a few recommended ways:

1.  **Using `sep=''` in the `print` function:**
    This is often the simplest change to your existing code. By setting `sep=''`, you instruct `print` not to insert any default separators between arguments. You then add spaces only where you explicitly want them.
    ```python
    # Original (produces '5 * 1  =  5'):
    # print(n,'*',i ,' = ', n * i)

    # Improved (produces '5*1 = 5'):
    print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n * i, sep='')
    ```

2.  **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**
    This is generally the most modern, readable, and concise way to format strings in Python.
    ```python
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

3.  **Using `str.format()` method:**
    A very flexible and powerful string formatting method.
    ```python
    print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, n*i))
    ```

4.  **String Concatenation:**
    Explicitly convert numbers to strings and concatenate them.
    ```python
    print(str(n) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(n*i))
    ```

Implementing any of these changes will correct the output format and should resolve the "Wrong Answer" issue, allowing your program to pass.
