### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary:**
The task is to write a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. This typically means displaying the results of `n * 1` through `n * 10`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program reads the input number using `sys.stdin.readline()`. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through a range of numbers, constructing each line of the multiplication table as a string (e.g., `N*M=Result`). These lines are appended to a single `table` string, separated by newlines, and the entire `table` is printed at the end.

**Code Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the integer input from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and `int()`.
*   **Looping Structure:** A `for` loop is an appropriate construct for iterating a fixed number of times to generate the table entries.
*   **String Accumulation:** Building the output as a single string before printing (using `table += ...`) is a valid approach for consolidating output.

**Code Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
*   **Incorrect Loop Range (Primary Issue):** The most significant weakness, and likely the direct cause of the "Wrong Answer" verdict, is the loop `for n in range(11):`. This range generates numbers from 0 to 10 (inclusive). Standard multiplication tables typically start from `N * 1`. By including `N * 0 = 0`, the program prints an extra line at the beginning and shifts all subsequent lines, resulting in output that does not exactly match the expected format or content of a `1` to `10` multiplication table.
*   **Output Format (Potential Secondary Issue):** The output format `N*M=RESULT` (e.g., `3*1=3`) lacks spaces around the `*` and `=` operators. While the problem description does not explicitly dictate the output format, many programming contest platforms and common expectations for such problems prefer or require spaces (e.g., `3 * 1 = 3`). If the judge expects spaces, this could also contribute to the "Wrong Answer".

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Adjust Loop Range:** To align with the standard definition of a multiplication table (from 1 to 10), change the loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
    ```python
    # Change this:
    # for n in range(11):
    # To this:
    for i in range(1, 11): # 'i' is a more common loop variable name
    ```
2.  **Improve Output Formatting:**
    *   If spaces are desired for readability or required by the judge, include them in your string concatenation:
        ```python
        table += str(x) + ' * ' + str(i) + ' = ' +  str(x * i) + '\n'
        ```
    *   For cleaner code, consider using f-strings (available in Python 3.6+) or `str.format()`:
        ```python
        # Using f-string with no spaces around * and =
        table += f"{x}*{i}={x*i}\n"
        # Using f-string with spaces around * and =
        table += f"{x} * {i} = {x*i}\n"
        ```
3.  **Direct Printing (Alternative):** For problems requiring line-by-line output, it's often simpler to print directly within the loop rather than accumulating a large string:
    ```python
    import sys
    x = int(sys.stdin.readline())

    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{x}*{i}={x*i}") # Or f"{x} * {i} = {x*i}" for spaces
    ```
