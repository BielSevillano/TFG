### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**1. Summary of Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input number, then iterating from 1 to 10. In each iteration, it constructs a string representing one line of the multiplication table (e.g., "n*i = result") and appends it to a main `table` string, finally printing the entire accumulated string.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correct Input Parsing:** The code correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer using `int()`.
*   **Correct Iteration Range:** The `for n in range(1, 11)` loop correctly covers the desired multiplication range from 1 to 10, inclusive.
*   **Correct Multiplication Logic:** The calculation `x * n` correctly computes the product for each line of the table.
*   **String Concatenation:** The use of `str()` to convert numbers to strings for concatenation is appropriate for building the output lines.

**Weaknesses and Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
*   **Logical Error in Output Formatting (Primary Issue):** The main flaw lies in how the `table` string is built, specifically the conditional `if n == 10:` block.
    *   For `n` from 1 to 9, the code adds `str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' + str(x * n) + '\n'` to `table`. This correctly adds each line followed by a newline.
    *   When `n` becomes 10, the loop first executes `table += str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' + str(x * n) + '\n'`. This adds "X*10 = (X*10)" followed by a newline.
    *   Immediately after, the `if n == 10:` condition is true, and it executes `table += str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' + str(x * n)`. This *duplicates* the last line ("X*10 = (X*10)") but *without* a trailing newline character.
    *   This results in an output that has an extra, identical line at the very end and typically does not terminate with a newline character, which is a common requirement for online judges. This discrepancy in the output format is why the program receives a "Wrong Answer."
*   **Inefficient String Building (Minor):** Repeatedly concatenating strings using `+=` can be less efficient for very large outputs compared to appending to a list and then using `str.join()`, or directly printing each line. For only 10 lines, this performance impact is negligible, but it's a good practice point.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

1.  **Remove the Redundant Conditional Block:** The most critical fix is to remove the `if n == 10:` block entirely. The loop's primary concatenation handles all lines, including the last one, correctly.

    **Corrected Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    import sys
    	
    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)

    table = ''
    for n in range(1,11):
    	table += str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' +  str(x * n) + '\n'
    # Remove the problematic 'if n == 10:' block here
    print(table) 
    ```
    *Even better, see suggestion 2.*

2.  **Direct Printing within the Loop (Recommended):** Instead of building a single large string, it's generally simpler and more Pythonic to print each line directly within the loop. The `print()` function automatically adds a newline character by default, simplifying output management.

    **Improved Code:**
    ```python
    import sys
    	
    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)

    for n in range(1,11):
    	print(str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' +  str(x * n))
    ```

3.  **Use `input()` for Simplicity:** For reading a single line of input, `input()` is often preferred over `sys.stdin.readline()` as it's more concise and automatically handles stripping the newline character.

    **Further Refinement:**
    ```python
    # No need to import sys if using input()
    n_input = int(input()) 

    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(str(n_input) + '*' + str(i) + ' = ' +  str(n_input * i))
    ```

4.  **Leverage f-strings for Cleaner Formatting (Python 3.6+):** f-strings provide a very readable way to format output strings.

    **Most Pythonic Solution:**
    ```python
    n_input = int(input()) 

    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n_input}*{i} = {n_input * i}")
    ```

By implementing these suggestions, particularly removing the problematic conditional and directly printing each line, the program will produce the correct output format and pass the tests.
