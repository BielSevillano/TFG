### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table from `n * 1` to `n * 10`.

The provided solution effectively addresses this problem by:
*   Reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`.
*   Converting the input string to an integer.
*   Utilizing a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
*   Inside the loop, calculating the product `n * i` for each `i`.
*   Printing the expression `n * i = result` in the specified format for each iteration.

**2. Code Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program successfully solves the problem, as indicated by the "Accepted" status. It correctly calculates and displays the multiplication table.
*   **Efficiency:** For the given constraints (a single input `n` and only 10 iterations), the program is highly efficient and executes very quickly.
*   **Readability and Clarity:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand. Variable names (`n`, `i`) are clear, and the use of a `for` loop makes the logic transparent. This approach is significantly superior to the reference solution, which manually prints each line, demonstrating good use of iteration for repetitive tasks.
*   **Conciseness:** The solution is compact and to the point, solving the problem with minimal lines of code.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Input Method:** While `sys.stdin.readline()` works, for reading a single line of input from the user in Python, the built-in `input()` function is generally more idiomatic, simpler, and equally effective. `sys.stdin.readline()` is typically preferred in competitive programming for very large inputs where slight I/O performance gains might matter.
*   **String Formatting:** The output string is constructed using multiple `str()` conversions and string concatenations (`str(n)+'*'+str(i), '=', n*i`). While functional, this can become less readable for more complex strings.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Use `input()` for cleaner input:** Replace the two lines for reading input with the more common and Pythonic approach:
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    ```
    This combines reading the line and converting it to an integer into a single, clearer step.

*   **Utilize f-strings for better output formatting:** Modern Python offers f-strings (formatted string literals) which provide a more concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.
    Change the print statement from:
    ```python
    print(str(n)+'*'+str(i), '=', n*i)
    ```
    to:
    ```python
    print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This makes the output formatting much clearer and often slightly more efficient than multiple concatenations.
