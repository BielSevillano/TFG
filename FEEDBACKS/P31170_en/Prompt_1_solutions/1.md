### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The provided program addresses this by first reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the product of `n` and the current loop number `i`, and prints the multiplication expression along with its result in the format "n * i = n*i".

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for a standard 1-10 multiplication table, as confirmed by its "Accepted" status.
*   **Readability:** The code is straightforward, concise, and easy to understand, even for someone new to Python. The variable names are clear.
*   **Efficiency:** For the small fixed number of iterations (10), the program is highly efficient. It performs a minimal number of operations and avoids any complex computations or data structures.
*   **Generalizability:** The use of a `for` loop makes the solution easily adaptable. Should the requirement change to print a multiplication table up to, say, 12 or 20, only the `range()` function's upper limit needs to be adjusted. This is a significant advantage over a hardcoded, line-by-line solution.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Input Method:** While `sys.stdin.readline()` is functional, `input()` is generally the more idiomatic and simpler way to read user input in Python, especially for competitive programming problems or simple scripts where performance isn't a critical concern for input operations. `sys.stdin.readline()` often includes the newline character, which `int()` intelligently handles here, but it's a detail worth noting.
*   **String Formatting:** The use of multiple `str()` conversions and `+` operators for string concatenation, while correct, is less modern and potentially less readable than using f-strings or the `str.format()` method, especially as the complexity of the output string increases.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Use `input()` for cleaner input:**
    Replace `n = int(sys.stdin.readline())` with the more Pythonic:
    ```python
    n = int(input())
    ```
    This makes the input handling more conventional and slightly simpler.

2.  **Enhance String Formatting with f-strings:**
    For improved readability and a more modern Python approach to string formatting, consider using f-strings (formatted string literals):
    ```python
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")
    ```
    This version is more concise, easier to read, and automatically handles the conversion of `n`, `i`, and `n*i` to strings, eliminating the need for explicit `str()` calls and repeated `+` operators.

By implementing these small changes, the program would become even more aligned with current Python best practices while retaining all its current strengths.
