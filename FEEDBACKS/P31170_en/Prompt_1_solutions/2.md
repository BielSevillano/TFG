**Feedback for the Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach**

The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table.

Your program attempts to solve this by:
*   Reading the input number `n` as an integer using `easyinput.read(int)`.
*   Using a `for` loop to iterate through numbers `i` from 1 to 9 (inclusive).
*   Inside the loop, it tries to construct and print a string representing each line of the multiplication table, in the format "n \* i = n\*i".

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Strengths:**
*   **Efficient Iteration:** The most significant strength is the use of a `for` loop with `range(1, 10, 1)`. This is a very efficient and Pythonic way to generate the sequence of multipliers from 1 to 9. It avoids repetitive code, making the solution concise and easily scalable if the table needed to go up to a higher number. This approach is superior to manually writing out each line, as seen in the longer reference solution.
*   **Clear Intent:** The `print` statement clearly shows the intention to display the number, the multiplier, and their calculated product.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Execution Error: Type Mismatch in String Concatenation:** This is the direct cause of the "Execution Error". In Python, you cannot directly concatenate (join) integers with strings using the `+` operator.
    *   `n` is an integer.
    *   `'*'` is a string.
    *   `i` is an integer.
    *   The expression `n + '*' + i + ' = ' + n*i` attempts operations like `integer + string` (e.g., `n + '*'`), which results in a `TypeError`. All operands to the `+` operator for string concatenation must be strings.
*   **Multiplication Table Range:** The `range(1, 10, 1)` correctly covers multipliers from 1 to 9. However, standard multiplication tables often include multiplication by 10. The provided reference solution also goes up to 10. While not strictly an error given the prompt's `n` constraint, it's a common expectation for a "multiplication table".

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

The main fix required is to correctly handle type conversion when creating the output string.

1.  **Correct Type Conversion for String Output (Essential Fix):**
    You need to convert the integers (`n`, `i`, and `n*i`) to strings before attempting to concatenate them with other strings.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 10): # Covers 1 to 9
        print(str(n) + '*' + str(i) + ' = ' + str(n * i))
    ```

2.  **Use F-strings for Readability (Highly Recommended):**
    F-strings (formatted string literals, available in Python 3.6+) offer a much cleaner and more readable way to embed expressions directly within string literals. Python automatically handles the conversion to string for the embedded expressions.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 10): # Covers 1 to 9
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")
    ```

3.  **Extend Table to 10 (Optional Improvement):**
    If a full multiplication table up to 10 is desired, simply adjust the `range` function. `range(1, 11)` will iterate from 1 up to (but not including) 11, thus covering 1 through 10.

    ```python
    from easyinput import read

    n = read(int)
    for i in range(1, 11): # Covers 1 to 10
        print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}")
    ```

By implementing the `str()` conversions or, even better, using f-strings, your program will resolve the `Execution Error` and correctly print the multiplication table using your well-structured loop logic.
