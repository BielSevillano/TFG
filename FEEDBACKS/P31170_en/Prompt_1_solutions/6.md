### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem asks for a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The output format should be `n*multiplier=result` for each line.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program reads the input number using `sys.stdin.readline()`, converts it to an integer, and then iterates through a loop from 0 to 10 (inclusive). In each iteration, it constructs a string representing a line of the multiplication table (e.g., "5*3=15") and appends it to a `table` string, along with a newline character. Finally, it prints the entire accumulated `table` string.

**Code Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Clear Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the input number and converts it to an integer. Using `sys.stdin.readline()` is a valid method for input, especially in environments where `input()` might be slower for very large inputs (though less critical for this problem).
*   **Loop-based Iteration:** Using a `for` loop is an appropriate and efficient way to generate all lines of the multiplication table systematically.
*   **Efficient String Building:** By building the entire output string (`table`) and printing it once at the end, the program reduces the overhead of multiple `print()` calls, which can be more efficient for larger outputs.
*   **Correct Arithmetic and String Conversion:** The calculations (`x * n`) and subsequent conversions to string (`str()`) for concatenation are handled correctly.

**Weaknesses (and reason for "Wrong Answer"):**
*   **Incorrect Range for Multiplication Table:** The most significant issue, leading to the "Wrong Answer", is the loop `for n in range(11)`. This generates multiplication results from `x * 0` up to `x * 10`. Standard multiplication tables, and as implied by the reference solution, typically start from `x * 1`. Including `x * 0` (which is always 0) likely causes the output to not match the expected format or content for the test cases.
*   **Variable Naming (Minor):** While functional, the choice of variable names could be slightly clearer. `x` is used for the input number, and `n` is used for the loop counter (multiplier). Conventionally, if the problem refers to the input as `n`, it might be more intuitive to use `n` for the input variable and `i` or `multiplier` for the loop counter.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Loop Range:** To match the standard multiplication table (1 to 10), change the loop range:
    ```python
    for n in range(1, 11): # This will iterate from 1 up to (but not including) 11, i.e., 1 to 10.
    ```
    This is the primary change needed to fix the "Wrong Answer".

2.  **Improve Variable Naming (Optional but Recommended):**
    ```python
    import sys

    input_num_str = sys.stdin.readline()
    input_num = int(input_num_str)

    table = ''
    for multiplier in range(1, 11): # Loop from 1 to 10
        table += str(input_num) + '*' + str(multiplier) + '=' +  str(input_num * multiplier) + '\n'
    print(table)
    ```

3.  **Consider Using `input()` (Optional):** For simple single-line integer input like this, `input()` is often sufficient and slightly more concise than `sys.stdin.readline()`.
    ```python
    # Using input() instead of sys.stdin.readline()
    # input_num = int(input())
    # ... rest of the code ...
    ```

4.  **Use F-strings for Cleaner Formatting (Optional):** F-strings offer a more readable way to format strings in Python 3.6+.
    ```python
    # ... inside the loop ...
    # table += f"{input_num}*{multiplier}={input_num * multiplier}\n"
    ```
