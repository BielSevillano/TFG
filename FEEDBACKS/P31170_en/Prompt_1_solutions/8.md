### Feedback: Multiplication Table Program

**Problem Summary:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table. The exact range for the multiplication table (e.g., up to `n*10` or `n*12`) is not explicitly stated in the problem description, but typically extends to at least 10.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided Python program approaches this problem by first reading the input number `n` as an integer. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through a sequence of numbers (from 1 to 9). Inside the loop, for each number `i` in the sequence, it prints a line representing the multiplication `n * i = n*i`. The `sep=''` argument in the `print` function is used to ensure that the elements are concatenated directly without any default spaces.

**Code Strengths:**
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The code is very concise, clear, and easy to understand.
*   **Correct Input Handling:** It correctly reads the input using `int(input())`.
*   **Efficient Iteration:** Using a `for` loop with `range()` is an efficient and Pythonic way to generate the sequence of multipliers.
*   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `n*i` is performed accurately.
*   **Controlled Output Formatting:** The use of `sep=''` in the `print` function effectively controls the spacing between elements, producing a clean output that closely matches typical multiplication table displays.

**Code Weaknesses / Reason for "Wrong Answer":**
*   **Incomplete Multiplication Range:** The primary reason for the "Wrong Answer" verdict is likely that the loop `for i in range(1, 10):` generates multipliers from 1 up to, but not including, 10. This means the program prints results for `n * 1` through `n * 9`. However, standard multiplication tables (and as hinted by the provided reference solution) typically include the multiplication by 10 (i.e., `n * 10`). By omitting this final line, the program's output is considered incomplete relative to the expected output.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1.  **Adjust Loop Range:** To ensure the multiplication table includes `n * 10`, modify the `range` in the `for` loop. Change `range(1, 10)` to `range(1, 11)`. This will make the loop iterate from `i = 1` up to `i = 10` (inclusive), thereby printing the complete table as expected by the system.

    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11): # Changed 10 to 11 to include 10
        print(n, "*", i, " = ", n*i , sep='')
    ```
