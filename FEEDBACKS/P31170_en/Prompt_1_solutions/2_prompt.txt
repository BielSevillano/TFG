                This is the program:

                from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
for i in range(1,10,1):
    print(n +'*'+ i +' = ' + n*i)


                The result of the program is: Execution Error

                The feedback should include:
                - A brief summary of the problem and the solution approach.
                - An analysis of the code's strengths and weaknesses.
                - Suggestions for improvement, if any.

                You can rely on the following other possible solutions to the same problem for reference:
                x = int(input())


print(str(x)+"*"+"1"+" = "+str(x*1))
print(str(x)+"*"+"2"+" = "+str(x*2))
print(str(x)+"*"+"3"+" = "+str(x*3))
print(str(x)+"*"+"4"+" = "+str(x*4))
print(str(x)+"*"+"5"+" = "+str(x*5))
print(str(x)+"*"+"6"+" = "+str(x*6))
print(str(x)+"*"+"7"+" = "+str(x*7))
print(str(x)+"*"+"8"+" = "+str(x*8))
print(str(x)+"*"+"9"+" = "+str(x*9))
print(str(x)+"*"+"10"+" = "+str(x*10))
