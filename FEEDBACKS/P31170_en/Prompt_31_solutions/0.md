### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**1. Problem Summary and Solution Approach:**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and then prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

The submitted program efficiently solves this by:
*   Reading the input number `n` using `int(input())`.
*   Utilizing a `for` loop that iterates `i` from 1 to 10 (inclusive) using `range(1, 11)`.
*   Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints each line of the multiplication table.

**2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**
*   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and prints the multiplication table for the given input, adhering to the problem's requirements.
*   **Loop Usage:** The `for` loop with `range(1, 11)` is the most Pythonic and straightforward way to handle iteration over a fixed sequence, making the code concise and readable for its core logic.
*   **Efficiency:** For a small, fixed number of iterations (10), the program is highly efficient, performing simple arithmetic operations and output statements.
*   **Clarity of Calculation:** The multiplication `(n)*i` is clear and direct.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Output Formatting Verbosity:** The main weakness lies in how the output string is constructed. It uses three separate `print` statements per line, leveraging `sep=''` and `end=' '` to control spacing and prevent newlines. While functional, this approach is more verbose and less idiomatic Python compared to using a single `print` statement with f-strings or `str.format()` for clearer and more concise output formatting. This can make the code slightly harder to read and maintain.

    Example of current output construction:
    `print(n ,'*', i, sep='', end=' ')` -> "N*I " (with a trailing space)
    `print('= ', end='')` -> "= " (appended)
    `print((n)*i)` -> "RESULT\n" (appended, then newline)
    Resulting in: `N*I = RESULT`

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

The program is "Accepted," meaning it fully meets the problem's criteria. The suggested improvements primarily focus on enhancing readability and conciseness in output formatting, which are good practices for more complex programs.

1.  **Consolidate Print Statements using F-strings (Recommended for Python 3.6+):**
    Using f-strings provides a very readable and concise way to embed variables directly into a string literal, eliminating the need for multiple `print` calls and complex `sep`/`end` manipulations.

    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```

2.  **Consolidate Print Statements using `str.format()`:**
    This is another excellent and widely compatible method for formatting strings.

    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, n*i))
    ```

3.  **Consolidate Print Statements using `print` with `sep=''`:**
    If the exact "N*I = RESULT" spacing is desired without f-strings or `.format()`, you can use a single `print` call and set the `sep` parameter.

    ```python
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')
    ```
    *Note:* The extra space around `=` in `' = '` is explicitly added here to maintain the desired output format, as `sep=''` removes all default spaces.

Any of these improvements would make the output formatting section of the code cleaner and more aligned with common Python best practices, without altering its correctness or efficiency.
