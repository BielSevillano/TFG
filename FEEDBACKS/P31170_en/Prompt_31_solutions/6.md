### Feedback on Multiplication Table Program

**Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**

The problem asks to read a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. The provided program addresses this by reading the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()`, converting it to an integer, and then using a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `n * i` and prints a sentence describing the multiplication.

**Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Logic:** The core logic for generating the multiplication table is sound. It correctly reads the input number and iterates through the numbers 1 to 10, calculating the correct product for each.
*   **Clear Iteration:** The `for i in range(1, 11):` loop is clear and correctly covers the required range (1 through 10 inclusive).
*   **Variable Naming:** The variable names `x` for the input number and `i` for the multiplier are standard and easy to understand.
*   **Input Handling:** Using `sys.stdin.readline()` followed by `int()` is a valid way to read integer input in Python.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Output Format (Primary Issue):** The main reason for the "Wrong Answer" is the output format. The problem implicitly expects a specific, concise format for the multiplication table (e.g., `n*i = result`). Your program prints a verbose sentence ("the multiplication of X times Y is Z"). Automated judges are very strict about exact output matching. For instance, if `n=5`, the program outputs `the multiplication of 5 times 1 is 5`, while the expected output is likely `5*1 = 5`.
*   **Verbosity of Input:** While `sys.stdin.readline()` works, for simple integer input, `input()` is generally more common and slightly more concise in Python (`x = int(input())`). However, this is a minor stylistic choice and not a functional error in this context.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Correct the Output Format:** This is the most critical change. Modify the `print` statement to match the standard multiplication table format. You can use f-strings (Python 3.6+), `str.format()`, or string concatenation.

    *   **Using f-strings (Recommended for modern Python):**
        ```python
        print(f"{x}*{i} = {x*i}")
        ```
    *   **Using `str.format()`:**
        ```python
        print("{}*{} = {}".format(x, i, x*i))
        ```
    *   **Using string concatenation:**
        ```python
        print(str(x) + "*" + str(i) + " = " + str(x*i))
        ```

    Any of these will produce output like `5*1 = 5`, which is what the automated judge will likely expect.

2.  **Consider using `input()`:** For straightforward integer input, `x = int(input())` is often preferred for its simplicity over `import sys` and `sys.stdin.readline()`. It won't change the correctness, but it can make the code slightly cleaner for this type of problem.

By addressing the output format, your program will correctly pass the tests for this problem, as the underlying logic for calculating the multiplication table is already sound.
