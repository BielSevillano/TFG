Here's a feedback text for the program:

**Feedback for Multiplication Table Program**

**1. Brief Summary of the Problem and Solution Approach:**
The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table up to 10.
The provided program solves this by first reading the integer `n` using `jutge.read()`. It then employs a `for` loop to iterate `i` from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the product `a = n * i` and prints the expression `n * i = a` on a new line for each iteration.

**2. Analysis of the Code's Strengths and Weaknesses:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correctness:** The program correctly calculates and displays the multiplication table for the given input `n` from 1 to 10.
    *   **Clarity:** The logic is straightforward and easy to understand. It clearly shows the iteration, multiplication, and printing steps.
    *   **Appropriate Loop Usage:** The `for` loop with `range(1, 11, 1)` is effectively used to generate the sequence of multipliers (1 through 10).
    *   **Readability:** Variable names (`n`, `i`, `a`) are simple and convey their purpose.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Output Formatting Verbosity:** The construction of each output line (`n*i = a`) uses three separate `print` statements with `end=""`. While functionally correct, this approach is more verbose and less idiomatic Python than using a single `print` statement with string formatting or the `sep` argument. It can make the code slightly less concise.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**

To enhance conciseness and adhere more closely to common Python practices for string formatting, the three `print` statements within the loop can be combined into a single one. Here are a couple of ways to achieve this, maintaining the same output format (`n*i = a` with spaces around `=`):

1.  **Using f-strings (Recommended for Python 3.6+):** This is generally the most readable and modern approach.
    ```python
    # Original:
    # print(n, end="")
    # print("*", end="")
    # print(i, "=", a)

    # Improved:
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {a}")
    ```

2.  **Using `str.format()`:** A good alternative for broader compatibility or when more complex formatting rules are needed.
    ```python
    # Improved:
    print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, a))
    ```
Either of these improvements would make the code more concise and equally effective in producing the desired output.
