**Feedback for Multiplication Table Program**

**Problem Summary:**
The task is to write a program that accepts a single natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) as input and then displays its multiplication table for values from 1 to 10. The output format for each line should typically be `N*I = RESULT`.

**Solution Approach:**
The provided program reads the input number `n` using `sys.stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer. It then initializes an empty string `table`. A `for` loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 10. In each iteration, it constructs a string representing one line of the multiplication table (e.g., "5*1 = 5\n") and concatenates it to the `table` variable. Finally, after the loop completes, the entire `table` string is printed to standard output.

**Code Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Clear and Logical:** The code's logic is easy to follow. It correctly identifies the need to loop from 1 to 10 and perform the multiplication.
    *   **Correct Calculation:** The multiplication `x * n` is accurately performed in each iteration.
    *   **Efficient Loop:** The `for` loop efficiently generates all ten lines of the multiplication table.

*   **Weaknesses & Root Cause of "Presentation Error":**
    *   **Output Formatting (Extra Newline):** The primary reason for the "Presentation Error" is most likely an extra newline character at the very end of the output. The program constructs the `table` string by appending `'\n'` to each line, including the last one. When `print(table)` is executed, the `print()` function itself adds another newline character after printing the entire content of `table`. This results in one more newline at the end of the program's output than typically expected by automated judging systems, which often require an exact match to the reference output.
    *   **Input Method (Minor):** While using `sys.stdin.readline()` followed by `int()` is functionally correct, for simple single-line integer inputs in Python, the built-in `input()` function (e.g., `x = int(input())`) is generally considered more Pythonic and concise.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Resolve the Extra Newline (Recommended Fix for "Presentation Error"):**
    The most straightforward way to eliminate the superfluous newline is to print each line directly within the loop, allowing the `print()` function to add exactly one newline per line, and no extra newline at the very end of the output.

    ```python
    import sys
    
    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    x = int(x)
    
    for n in range(1, 11):
        # Print each line directly. 'print' automatically adds a newline.
        print(str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' + str(x * n))
    ```
    Alternatively, if you prefer to build a list of lines first, you can join them:
    ```python
    # ... (input reading) ...
    lines = []
    for n in range(1, 11):
        lines.append(str(x) + '*' + str(n) + ' = ' + str(x * n))
    print('\n'.join(lines)) # This joins the lines with newlines but adds no final newline
    ```

2.  **Simplify Input Reading (Optional):**
    For cleaner code when reading simple integer input:
    ```python
    # import sys # Not needed if only using input()
    x = int(input())
    # ... rest of the code ...
    ```

3.  **Improve String Formatting (Optional for Readability):**
    Using f-strings (Python 3.6+) or the `.format()` method can often make string construction more readable:
    ```python
    # Using f-strings:
    # print(f"{x}*{n} = {x * n}")
    
    # Using .format():
    # print("{}*{} = {}".format(x, n, x * n))
    ```

By applying the first suggestion (printing each line directly in the loop), the "Presentation Error" should be resolved, making the program's output conform precisely to typical judging requirements.
