### Feedback for Multiplication Table Program

**1. Problem and Solution Approach Summary**

The problem requires writing a program that reads a natural number `n` (between 1 and 9) and prints its multiplication table. The provided program attempts to solve this by reading the input `n` using `easyinput.read()` and then using a `for` loop to iterate through multipliers from 1 to 9. Inside the loop, it tries to construct and print each line of the multiplication table.

**2. Analysis of Code's Strengths and Weaknesses**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly uses `from easyinput import read` and `n = read(int)` to get the integer input `n`, which is suitable for the problem's environment.
    *   **Loop Structure:** The `for i in range(1, 10, 1):` loop correctly iterates through the multipliers from 1 up to (but not including) 10, meaning it covers 1 through 9. This correctly sets up the iteration for the multiplication table.
    *   **Multiplication Logic:** The `n*i` calculation within the print statement correctly computes the product for each line.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Execution Error (TypeError):** The primary weakness and cause of the "Execution Error" is the attempt to concatenate integers (like `n` and `i`) directly with strings (like `'*'` and `' = '`) using the `+` operator. Python's `+` operator for strings requires all operands to be strings. For example, `n + '*'` will raise a `TypeError` because `n` is an integer.
    *   **Incomplete Table (Minor):** While the problem statement doesn't explicitly define the upper limit for the multiplication table, common practice and most of the provided reference solutions extend the table up to `n * 10`. The current `range(1, 10, 1)` only goes up to `n * 9`.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement**

To resolve the `Execution Error` and improve the program, focus on correct string formatting:

1.  **Convert Numbers to Strings:** Explicitly convert `n`, `i`, and `n*i` to strings before concatenating them using `+`.
    ```python
    # Original problematic line:
    # print(n +'*'+ i +' = ' + n*i)

    # Corrected using str():
    print(str(n) + '*' + str(i) + ' = ' + str(n*i))
    ```
2.  **Use F-strings (Recommended for Modern Python):** F-strings offer a clean and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.
    ```python
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}")
    ```
3.  **Use `str.format()` Method:** Another robust string formatting option.
    ```python
    print("{}*{} = {}".format(n, i, n*i))
    ```
4.  **Use `print()` with Multiple Arguments and `sep`:** The `print()` function can take multiple arguments, which it converts to strings and separates by spaces by default. To remove extra spaces, set `sep=''`.
    ```python
    print(n, '*', i, ' = ', n*i, sep='')
    ```
5.  **Extend Table Range (Optional but Recommended):** To align with typical multiplication tables and many reference solutions, modify the `range` to include 10.
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11): # This will iterate from 1 to 10
        # ... print statement ...
    ```

**Example of an improved program incorporating these suggestions:**

```python
from easyinput import read

n = read(int)
for i in range(1, 11): # Loop from 1 to 10
    print(f"{n}*{i} = {n*i}") # Using an f-string for clear output
```
